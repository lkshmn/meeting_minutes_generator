      "[04:40.000 --> 04:59.000]  And she has been working in the space operations for the last seven years. So she's been scaling operations from starting from five satellites to more than 300 satellites launched to date.\n",
      "[04:59.000 --> 05:14.000]  Katia, welcome. Thanks, Valentina. Thanks to PyData for having me.\n",
      "[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  So let me share my screen.\n",
      "[05:21.000 --> 05:35.000]  All right. Yeah, so I'm going to talk today through what does it mean to operate satellites and then what does it mean to operate hundreds of them.\n",
      "[05:35.000 --> 05:43.000]  So yeah, as Valentina mentioned, I'm the team lead of the space operations group at Planet.\n",
      "[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  So we are actually a small team of people, less than 10.\n",
      "[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  And just, I want to start with showing you what does the constellation that we operate look like.\n",
      "[05:57.000 --> 06:04.000]  I think a visual way is the best way to do it.\n",
      "[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  Right.\n",
      "[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  So this is a day in the life of the doves.\n",
      "[06:13.000 --> 06:20.000]  So we call our satellites doves because they remind us to that they have two wings.\n",
      "[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  So yeah, we just, we call them doves and then a group of satellites, we will call them flocks.\n",
      "[06:26.000 --> 06:33.000]  So basically what our sites are doing, they are taking, they are air sensing, air remote sensing satellites.\n",
      "[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  So they are taking pictures of our Earth continuously, exactly as the simulation shows.\n",
      "[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  So they are acting like a line scanner.\n",
      "[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  So it's like having multiple cameras on the same plane, different planes.\n",
      "[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Just doing that, taking images of landmass as they pass over the Earth.\n",
      "[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  And having that constellation on the space allows us to take daily images of the entire landmass of the Earth.\n",
      "[06:59.000 --> 07:11.000]  And by having all that data, then we are able to inform decision makers and provide the visibility on changes that happen on the day to day that weren't there available before.\n",
      "[07:11.000 --> 07:22.000]  All right, so I want to give you a quick overview to what a constellation of satellites look like.\n",
      "[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  So we had actually three types of satellites.\n",
      "[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  So when I started working on space operations, I was working with the Rapid Eye constellation.\n",
      "[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  So those are five satellites the size of a fridge.\n",
      "[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  And they were launched in 2008 and they have been taking images up to 2020, so last year.\n",
      "[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  So we have this huge archive of data for all these years from this constellation.\n",
      "[07:51.000 --> 08:01.000]  And of course, even though they were designed to last six to seven years, they outgrow that period of time.\n",
      "[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  So they continue taking images even years after.\n",
      "[08:04.000 --> 08:18.000]  But it reaches a point where, you know, there's such degradation that we wanted to make sure that we had the capability of lowering their orbits so that they could be safely.\n",
      "[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  safely re-enter the atmosphere within a time that is responsible.\n",
      "[08:25.000 --> 08:31.000]  And then we have the doves and super doves.\n",
      "[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  So we have two generations of satellites and that's why we call them super doves.\n",
      "[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  Super doves are the latest iteration of our sets.\n",
      "[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  So we have launched to date more than 300 of these.\n",
      "[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  And we currently have in orbit more than 180 of these sets.\n",
      "[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  So to give you a sense of the scale, how different these sets are to the Rapid Eye.\n",
      "[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  So the Rapid Eye are like a mini fridge and the doves are like a shoebox size.\n",
      "[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  So 30 by 10 centimeters.\n",
      "[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  Like, yeah, they're very small, but they have very similar capabilities.\n",
      "[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  So they take images, what we call medium resolution.\n",
      "[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  So that means a pixel is equivalent to three meters.\n",
      "[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  Something that will be three meters on ground.\n",
      "[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  And then they image the earth on different bands.\n",
      "[09:25.000 --> 09:34.000]  So there are the visual bands that we see, red, green, blue, and then additional bands that will help us identify things like vegetation.\n",
      "[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  Yeah, vegetation in these indices that will help for agriculture detection, for example.\n",
      "[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  And then we have a constellation of high resolution satellites.\n",
      "[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  These are, we currently have 21 in space, and these are about the same size as the Rapid Eye.\n",
      "[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  So also like a mini fridge.\n",
      "[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  But these sets have the capability of taking like really high resolution images.\n",
      "[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  So sub meter resolution.\n",
      "[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  Okay, so that's what we have on a space.\n",
      "[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  So it's like having all these cameras around, like orbiting the earth.\n",
      "[10:10.000 --> 10:22.000]  So what system do we need to actually talk to the satellite and then make sure that we are getting health data from them and that we are getting all those pictures that they are taking down.\n",
      "[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  So this is in a nutshell what our system looks like.\n",
      "[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  So there's the space segment, which is all this group of satellites.\n",
      "[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  And then we, of course, have radios on board of them so that we can talk to to ground stations on earth.\n",
      "[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  And because we have such a large number of satellites on space, we also need a large number of ground stations on the ground.\n",
      "[10:46.000 --> 10:58.000]  So operations is not only about taking care of the satellites that are on space, but also taking care of the systems on ground that support the space system.\n",
      "[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  So I'm going to go into the detail on the radio frequencies and all, but there are like, to simplify, there are two types of communication.\n",
      "[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  So a low speed one and a high speed one.\n",
      "[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  So with low speed communication, we can get health data from the satellites and upload commands to them.\n",
      "[11:17.000 --> 11:27.000]  And with high rate radios, then we download all the images, which are a larger amount of data.\n",
      "[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  And then we need systems that will orchestrate how each of these resources are used.\n",
      "[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  Like to which satellites each antenna talking, how many times a day?\n",
      "[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  What is each satellite doing on a given day?\n",
      "[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  Like where is it taking images?\n",
      "[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  When it's supposed to point to the ground station to download data, when it's supposed to point to the ground and actually take a picture.\n",
      "[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  So those systems are also built in house for us.\n",
      "[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  So there is a scheduler that will make sure to de-conflict those resources.\n",
      "[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  There is mission control.\n",
      "[12:06.000 --> 12:17.000]  You probably have in mind the picture, you know, like in the latest Mars rover landing.\n",
      "[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  You see like a lot of monitors, each of them monitoring a subsystem.\n",
      "[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  And then engineers behind them, you know, sending the commands and monitoring the telemetry that comes from the spacecraft.\n",
      "[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  So basically that's what mission control does, but in a different setup.\n",
      "[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  So mission control for us is built on the cloud.\n",
      "[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  So, and it doesn't have a lot of people sitting 24 seven in front of them to monitor the sets.\n",
      "[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  So that is possible because we have a lot of automation in place.\n",
      "[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  And I'm going to elaborate more on that later.\n",
      "[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  But just, just to have the, the, the two differences.\n",
      "[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  So mission control for me is like now I'm sitting at home in Berlin and I can access it through my laptop, like from my couch.\n",
      "[13:03.000 --> 13:03.360]  Okay.\n",
      "[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And then I can come on the satellites from there.\n",
      "[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  And then of course we need.\n",
      "[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  Like a place where we store all the data that comes down.\n",
      "[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  So we have logs, we have telemetry, we have pictures.\n",
      "[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  And we want to make sure that all of these systems are built such that we can build on top of them.\n",
      "[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  So that they all have endpoints that we can query that data with other scripts that will run on top.\n",
      "[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  So those were designed from the very beginning with that on mind.\n",
      "[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Yeah. And then we have a different, what we call pipeline for, for the images.\n",
      "[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  And that's a different storage where each of the pictures get processed.\n",
      "[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  And there's some quality checks in between.\n",
      "[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  All of that automated because daily we have, daily we download more than 15 terabytes of data.\n",
      "[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  So we have to process all that data, of course, in a very automated way.\n",
      "[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  Yeah. And then once the images go through all that processing pipeline and image quality checks,\n",
      "[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  then they get published and delivered on a platform that our customers can access.\n",
      "[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  Cool. So how do we do all of that?\n",
      "[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  Of course, this wasn't like the picture at the beginning.\n",
      "[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  So we use Agile Aerospace on everything.\n",
      "[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  But what does Agile Aerospace mean?\n",
      "[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  So it's on its core is rapid iteration.\n",
      "[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  So on everything.\n",
      "[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  So from manufacturing the satellites to iterating quickly on the software the satellites are running,\n",
      "[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  on the software that we are running on ground, on how we do testing.\n",
      "[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  So one good example of rapid iteration is this DOVS.\n",
      "[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  It was actually not just one model.\n",
      "[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  So we have had more than 13 iterations over time.\n",
      "[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  Now we are past 13.\n",
      "[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  So what we do is put some new components, put the new software,\n",
      "[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  launch a new tech demo, test it on Arbita.\n",
      "[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  And if that works, then that will become the next version to launch.\n",
      "[15:16.000 --> 15:29.000]  So that's how we have been able to progress very quickly and get like always the latest and best packed into these three unit cubesat form over the years.\n",
      "[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  And that also that also happens on on the software side.\n",
      "[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  So the way we we process the data from space operation and space operations point of view to now has changed.\n",
      "[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  Following that that agile aerospace mentality.\n",
      "[15:46.000 --> 15:56.000]  And a key part of this when trying to do this is also always building the tools with that on mind.\n",
      "[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  With.\n",
      "[15:59.000 --> 16:09.000]  With having a scale like scalability on mind, knowing that, OK, now we are operating 20 sets, but in a year we might have 200 on orbit.\n",
      "[16:09.000 --> 16:21.000]  So that makes things easier and makes the system just robust to handle what what comes on the roadmap.\n",
      "[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  And I want to make a pause talking about agile to get into something exciting, which is this is also agile.\n",
      "[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  So to have that large number of satellites on the space, you need to launch them.\n",
      "[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  And launchers are also are.\n",
      "[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Well, no, no, the market is growing, but it's it's something that constraints right there.\n",
      "[16:43.000 --> 16:50.000]  Only enough launchers in the world, so we need to make sure that we are launching as often as we need.\n",
      "[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  So this is just a snapshot of what the year look like look like for us like the last year.\n",
      "[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  So we had launches.\n",
      "[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  OK, thanks.\n",
      "[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  Yeah, so we launched from a European rocket, the Vega.\n",
      "[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  There we had 26 of our newest doves, which we call super doves.\n",
      "[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  And then something interesting of that rocket is we have two different deployers.\n",
      "[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  So the satellites get deployed from what we call quad pods.\n",
      "[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  So it's basically like boxes with a spring that release the sats.\n",
      "[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  But there were two different of those systems on board.\n",
      "[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  So that was something new for us.\n",
      "[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  And then we launched six of our high resolution sky sats with SpaceX.\n",
      "[17:40.000 --> 17:47.000]  We actually had two SpaceX launches, one electron, one Vega, actually two electrons.\n",
      "[17:47.000 --> 17:56.000]  Yeah, so just that's another part that is also agile, you know, using as many opportunities as we can to get sats into space.\n",
      "[17:56.000 --> 18:10.000]  And to give you an idea of the amount of data that we have to deal with, the Global Ground Station Network last year collected over five petabytes of data.\n",
      "[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  So yeah, and our most recent launch was actually on January.\n",
      "[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  I put this because this was very exciting.\n",
      "[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  So it was a record breaking launcher.\n",
      "[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  You probably have seen.\n",
      "[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  I don't know.\n",
      "[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  Well, I always see the the live transmissions for any any rocket launch.\n",
      "[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  But this was a SpaceX record breaking one because this was the most small sets ever launch altogether.\n",
      "[18:36.000 --> 18:38.440]  So 143 satellites were.\n",
      "[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  put all together on this rocket and they all have the same.\n",
      "[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  Right.\n",
      "[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  So here we launched 48 super dogs.\n",
      "[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  So also on two different two different deployers.\n",
      "[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  And this was our 30th successful launch so far.\n",
      "[18:58.000 --> 19:07.000]  This is one of the images that one of our sites that were launching that on that rocket took right after being commissioned.\n",
      "[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  Cool.\n",
      "[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  Now I'm going to talk about how they operate.\n",
      "[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  So the concept of operations.\n",
      "[19:13.000 --> 19:20.000]  So you have an idea of what we have to do as a space operations then for automation.\n",
      "[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  So our dogs are a monitoring mission.\n",
      "[19:24.000 --> 19:32.000]  So monitoring means they are always taking pictures over landmass because that's our point of interest.\n",
      "[19:32.000 --> 19:38.000]  And then like if they are not taking images, then they are talking to the ground stations and downloading the data.\n",
      "[19:38.000 --> 19:50.000]  And what they are not doing either of those two things to be able to have them as a line scanner separated like in the video, we need to face them out.\n",
      "[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  So space them out along the orbital plane.\n",
      "[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  And to do that, we use differential drag maneuvers.\n",
      "[19:56.000 --> 20:04.000]  So like the satellite will be rotating so that the atmospheric drag will affect its position in relation to the others.\n",
      "[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  And they will slowly separate among the plane.\n",
      "[20:07.000 --> 20:08.000]  So those three things.\n",
      "[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  So it's pretty simple.\n",
      "[20:10.000 --> 20:17.000]  Well, it sounds simple, but yeah, that's basically what the sets have to do.\n",
      "[20:17.000 --> 20:24.000]  And one important thing to mention is like we don't do 24-7 ops.\n",
      "[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  So there's not a person there looking what each satellite is doing all the time.\n",
      "[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  And that's because we have a lot of automation in place.\n",
      "[20:34.000 --> 20:45.000]  So what we call nominal operations is basically all the tasks to make sure that the satellite is healthy and it's doing what it's supposed to.\n",
      "[20:45.000 --> 20:54.000]  So for us that, you know, it's able to take pictures and it's taking pictures and it's able to download them to the ground stations and it's downloading them.\n",
      "[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  So the first thing of all is like, how do you tell the satellite what to do?\n",
      "[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  So there comes the scheduler.\n",
      "[21:00.000 --> 21:18.000]  So the scheduler is an optimizer building house that will every day, you know, score areas of the landmass that each of the satellite can better take a picture of.\n",
      "[21:18.000 --> 21:26.000]  And then like that combined with the power budget of the satellite will just distribute images, imaging activities, we call them.\n",
      "[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  So it's loads where the sets are taking images to each of them.\n",
      "[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  What are real?\n",
      "[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  Why is a tiny isn't악?\n",
      "[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  So where can we do that?\n",
      "[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  Well, if all of the states.\n",
      "[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  All right.\n",
      "[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  So we'll go back and look.\n",
      "[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  Hey, Ungerman Marcus.\n",
      "[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  We'll try theéquipe icon.\n",
      "[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  What kind of Gesundheit information?\n",
      "[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  We'll record that.\n",
      "[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  Let's all right here thePs everyday.\n",
      "[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  All right.\n",
      "[21:43.000 --> 21:44.000]  Get along with the funniest step of the scivos.\n",
      "[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  Let's put the tours in the backyard.\n",

      "Speaker 0: Pi Data Berlin team. As far as I can see, maybe some others. Daniel, I guess. Daniel? We are Daniel. Yes, we are the building chapter of Pi Data and Pi Data, as some of you may have heard before, is the educational program of NumFocus and we will talk about, it will be introduced very soon. Our program for today is me, I am your introduction, happening now. And then we will have the second talk from Miladri Shekhardut about deepfake and why he has trust issues. Let's hope we can solve them to some. Yeah, some of them today. In between, we will have a five minute break and at the end, we can all meet up in this nice platform called Wonder. And later we will post in the chat the link so we can all gather there later. This meetup is recorded, so both talks are recorded and are also streamed now in YouTube, so please take it into consideration. Also, if you are watching on YouTube, you can also write down the questions in the YouTube chat and we will pass them on to the speaker. So yeah, as I mentioned, we are PyData Berlin. We are the local chapter of PyData, which is kind of a worldwide thing. We started in 2016 and we had quite a lot of fun meetups and conferences ever since. There is also a data science channel that you can follow and also find them if there are job posts there or you can ask technical problems.\n",
      "Speaker 1: I will stop the share now. It is sharing screen and I think Valentina will introduce our first speaker. Yeah, hi everyone. I'm Valentina, also co-organizer of PyData. I have the pleasure to introduce my colleague, Katia, who will be speaking about how Planet operates more than 100 satellites using agile aerospace.\n",
      "Speaker 2: So we are actually a small team of people, less than 10. And just, I want to start with showing you what does the constellation that we operate look like. I think a visual way is the best way to do it. Right. So this is a day in the life of the doves. So we call our satellites doves because they remind us to that they have two wings. So yeah, we just, we call them doves and then a group of satellites, we will call them flocks. So basically what our sites are doing, they are taking, they are air sensing, air remote sensing satellites. So they are taking pictures of our Earth continuously, exactly as the simulation shows. So they are acting like a line scanner. Just doing that, taking images of landmass as they pass over the Earth. And having that constellation on the space allows us to take daily images of the entire landmass of the Earth. And by having all that data, then we are able to inform decision makers and provide the visibility on changes that happen on the day to day that weren't there available before. So we had actually three types of satellites. So when I started working on space operations, I was working with the Rapid Eye constellation. So those are five satellites the size of a fridge. So they continue taking images even years after. But it reaches a point where, you know, there's such degradation that we wanted to make sure that we had the capability of lowering their orbits so that they could be safely. safely re-enter the atmosphere within a time that is responsible. And then we have the doves and super doves. So we have two generations of satellites and that's why we call them super doves. And we currently have in orbit more than 180 of these sets. So to give you a sense of the scale, how different these sets are to the Rapid Eye. So the Rapid Eye are like a mini fridge and the doves are like a shoebox size. So they take images, what we call medium resolution. So that means a pixel is equivalent to three meters. And then they image the earth on different bands. So there are the visual bands that we see, red, green, blue, and then additional bands that will help us identify things like vegetation. Yeah, vegetation in these indices that will help for agriculture detection, for example. These are, we currently have 21 in space, and these are about the same size as the Rapid Eye. So also like a mini fridge. But these sets have the capability of taking like really high resolution images. So sub meter resolution. Okay, so that's what we have on a space. So this is in a nutshell what our system looks like. So there's the space segment, which is all this group of satellites. And then we, of course, have radios on board of them so that we can talk to to ground stations on earth. So operations is not only about taking care of the satellites that are on space, but also taking care of the systems on ground that support the space system. So I'm going to go into the detail on the radio frequencies and all, but there are like, to simplify, there are two types of communication. So a low speed one and a high speed one. So with low speed communication, we can get health data from the satellites and upload commands to them. Like to which satellites each antenna talking, how many times a day? What is each satellite doing on a given day? Like where is it taking images? When it's supposed to point to the ground station to download data, when it's supposed to point to the ground and actually take a picture. So those systems are also built in house for us. So there is a scheduler that will make sure to de-conflict those resources. There is mission control. And then engineers behind them, you know, sending the commands and monitoring the telemetry that comes from the spacecraft. So basically that's what mission control does, but in a different setup. So mission control for us is built on the cloud. So that is possible because we have a lot of automation in place. And I'm going to elaborate more on that later. And then I can come on the satellites from there. And then of course we need. So we have logs, we have telemetry, we have pictures. And we want to make sure that all of these systems are built such that we can build on top of them. So that they all have endpoints that we can query that data with other scripts that will run on top. So those were designed from the very beginning with that on mind. Yeah. And then we have a different, what we call pipeline for, for the images. And that's a different storage where each of the pictures get processed. And there's some quality checks in between. Yeah. And then once the images go through all that processing pipeline and image quality checks, then they get published and delivered on a platform that our customers can access. So we use Agile Aerospace on everything. But what does Agile Aerospace mean? So it's on its core is rapid iteration. So on everything. on the software that we are running on ground, on how we do testing. It was actually not just one model. So we have had more than 13 iterations over time. Now we are past 13. launch a new tech demo, test it on Arbita. And if that works, then that will become the next version to launch. So that's how we have been able to progress very quickly and get like always the latest and best packed into these three unit cubesat form over the years. And that also that also happens on on the software side. So the way we we process the data from space operation and space operations point of view to now has changed. Following that that agile aerospace mentality. With. With having a scale like scalability on mind, knowing that, OK, now we are operating 20 sets, but in a year we might have 200 on orbit. So that makes things easier and makes the system just robust to handle what what comes on the roadmap. And I want to make a pause talking about agile to get into something exciting, which is this is also agile. So to have that large number of satellites on the space, you need to launch them. And launchers are also are. Only enough launchers in the world, so we need to make sure that we are launching as often as we need. So we had launches. OK, thanks. There we had 26 of our newest doves, which we call super doves. And then something interesting of that rocket is we have two different deployers. So it's basically like boxes with a spring that release the sats. So that was something new for us. And then we launched six of our high resolution sky sats with SpaceX. We actually had two SpaceX launches, one electron, one Vega, actually two electrons. So yeah, and our most recent launch was actually on January. I put this because this was very exciting. I don't know. Well, I always see the the live transmissions for any any rocket launch. But this was a SpaceX record breaking one because this was the most small sets ever launch altogether. So 143 satellites were. put all together on this rocket and they all have the same. Right. So here we launched 48 super dogs. So the concept of operations. So you have an idea of what we have to do as a space operations then for automation. So our dogs are a monitoring mission. So monitoring means they are always taking pictures over landmass because that's our point of interest. And then like if they are not taking images, then they are talking to the ground stations and downloading the data. So space them out along the orbital plane. And to do that, we use differential drag maneuvers.\n"
