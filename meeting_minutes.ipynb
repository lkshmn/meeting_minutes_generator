      "[04:29.000 --> 04:41.000]  Katia is the lead of the Space Operations Team for Planet and she has a background in telecommunication engineering, but also a passion for space.\n",
      "[04:41.000 --> 05:01.000]  And she has been working in the Space Operations for the last seven years. So she's been scaling operations from starting from five satellites to more than 300 satellites launched to date.\n",
      "[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  So Katia, welcome.\n",
      "[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  Thanks, Valentina. Thanks to PI Data for having me.\n",
      "[05:14.000 --> 05:25.000]  So, let me share my screen.\n",
      "[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  All right.\n",
      "[05:27.000 --> 05:38.440]  Yeah, so I'm going to talk today through what does it mean to operate satellites and then what does it mean to operate hundreds of them.\n",
      "[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  Yeah, as Valentina mentioned, I'm the team lead of the Space Operations Group at Planet.\n",
      "[05:45.000 --> 05:52.000]  So we are actually a small team of people, less than 10.\n",
      "[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  And just, I want to start with showing you what does the constellation that we operate look like.\n",
      "[05:59.000 --> 06:08.000]  I think visual way is the best way to do it.\n",
      "[06:08.000 --> 06:08.040]  Thanks. Thanks.\n",
      "[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  Right.\n",
      "[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  So this is a day in the life of the doves.\n",
      "[06:15.000 --> 06:22.000]  So we call our satellites doves because they remind us to that they have two wings.\n",
      "[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  So, yeah, we just, we call them doves.\n",
      "[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  And then a group of satellites, we will call them flogs.\n",
      "[06:28.000 --> 06:35.000]  So basically what our sites are doing, they are taking, they are air sensing, air remote sensing satellites.\n",
      "[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  So they are taking pictures of our Earth continuously, exactly as the simulation shows.\n",
      "[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  So they are acting like a line scanner.\n",
      "[06:43.000 --> 06:54.000]  So it's like having multiple cameras on the same plane, different planes, just doing that, taking images of landmass as they pass over the Earth.\n",
      "[06:54.000 --> 07:01.000]  And having that constellation on the space allows us to take daily images of the entire landmass of the Earth.\n",
      "[07:01.000 --> 07:13.000]  And by having all that data, then we are able to inform decision makers and provide the visibility on changes that happen on the day to day that weren't available before.\n",
      "[07:13.000 --> 07:24.000]  All right. So I want to give you a quick overview to what our constellation satellites look like.\n",
      "[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  So we had actually three types of satellites.\n",
      "[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  So when I started working on space operations, I was working with the Rapid Eye constellation.\n",
      "[07:35.000 --> 07:45.000]  So those are five satellites the size of a fridge and they were launched on 2008 and they have been taking images up to 2020.\n",
      "[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  So last year. So we have this huge archive of data.\n",
      "[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  data for all these years from this constellation.\n",
      "[07:54.000 --> 08:04.000]  And of course, even though they were designed to last six to seven years, they outgrow that that period of time.\n",
      "[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  So they continue taking images even years after.\n",
      "[08:07.000 --> 08:18.240]  But it reaches a point where, you know, there's such degradation that we we wanted to make sure that we had the capability of lowering their orbit so that they could be safely.\n",
      "[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  safely re-enter the atmosphere within a time that is responsible.\n",
      "[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  And then.\n",
      "[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  Then we have the doves and super doves.\n",
      "[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  So we have two generations of satellites and that's why we call them super doves.\n",
      "[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  Super doves are the latest iteration of our sets.\n",
      "[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  So we have launched to date more than 300 of these.\n",
      "[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  And we currently have in orbit more than 180 of these sets.\n",
      "[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  So to give you a sense of the scale, how different these sets are to the Rapid Eye.\n",
      "[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  So the Rapid Eye are like a mini fridge and the doves are like a shoebox size.\n",
      "[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  So 30 by by 10 centimeters.\n",
      "[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  Like, yeah, they're very small, but they have very similar capabilities.\n",
      "[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  So they take images what we call medium resolution.\n",
      "[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  So that means a pixel is equivalent to three meters.\n",
      "[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  Something that will be three meters on ground.\n",
      "[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  Um, and then they, they image the earth on different bands.\n",
      "[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  So there are the visual bands that we see red, green, blue, and then additional bands that will help us identify things like vegetation.\n",
      "[09:34.000 --> 09:43.000]  Um, uh, yeah, vegetation in these indices, uh, that will help for agriculture detection, for example.\n",
      "[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  Um, and then we have a constellation of high resolution satellites.\n",
      "[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  These are, uh, we currently have 21 in a space and these are about the same size as the Rapid Eye.\n",
      "[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  So also like a mini fridge.\n",
      "[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  Uh, but these sets have the capability of taking like really high resolution images.\n",
      "[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  So, um, submit, sub meter resolution.\n",
      "[10:02.000 --> 10:02.940]  Um,\n",
      "[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  So that's what we have on a space.\n",
      "[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  So it's like having all these cameras around, uh, like orbiting the air.\n",
      "[10:12.000 --> 10:24.000]  Um, so what system do we need to actually talk to the satellite and then, uh, make sure that we are, uh, getting health data from them and that we are getting all those pictures that they are taking down.\n",
      "[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  Um, so this is in a nutshell, what our system looks like.\n",
      "[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  Um, so there's the space segment.\n",
      "[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  So, which is all this group of satellites.\n",
      "[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  Uh, and then we of course have radios on board of them so that we can talk to, to ground stations on earth.\n",
      "[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  Um, and because we have such a large number of satellites on space, we also need a large number of ground stations on the ground.\n",
      "[10:48.000 --> 10:59.000]  So operations is not only about taking care of the satellites that are on space, but also taking care of the, um, of the systems on ground that support the space system.\n",
      "[10:59.000 --> 11:10.000]  Um, so I'm going to go into the detail on the radio frequencies and all, but there are like, uh, to simplify, there are two types of communication.\n",
      "[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  So a low speed one and a high speed one.\n",
      "[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  So with low speed communication, we can get health data from the satellites and, um, upload commands to them.\n",
      "[11:19.000 --> 11:30.000]  And with high, um, with high rate, uh, radios, then we download, you know, all the images, which are, um, a larger amount of data.\n",
      "[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  Um, and then we need systems that will orchestrate.\n",
      "[11:35.000 --> 11:45.000]  Um, how each of these resources are used, like, um, to which satellites each antenna talking, uh, how many times a day, uh, what is each satellite doing on a given day?\n",
      "[11:45.000 --> 11:55.000]  Like, where is it taking images? Um, when it's supposed to, uh, point to the ground station to download data, when it's supposed to point to, to the ground and actually take a picture.\n",
      "[11:55.000 --> 12:05.000]  Um, so those systems are also, uh, built in house, um, so for us, so there is a scheduler that will make sure to de-conflict those resources.\n",
      "[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Um, there is mission control.\n",
      "[12:08.000 --> 12:19.000]  Um, you probably, um, have in mind the picture, you know, like in the latest, um, uh, Mars, uh, rover landing.\n",
      "[12:19.000 --> 12:27.000]  You see like a lot of monitors, each of them monitoring a subsystem and then engineers behind them.\n",
      "[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Um, you know, sending the commands and make monitoring the, the telemetry that comes from the spacecraft.\n",
      "[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  So basically that's what mission control does.\n",
      "[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  Um, but in a different setup.\n",
      "[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  So, um, mission control for us is built on the cloud.\n",
      "[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  So, um, and it doesn't have, um, a lot of people sitting 24 seven in front of them to monitor the sets.\n",
      "[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  So, um, that is possible because we have a lot of automation in place and I'm going to elaborate more on that later.\n",
      "[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  Uh, but just, just to have the, the, the two differences.\n",
      "[12:58.000 --> 13:07.000]  So mission control for me is like now I'm sitting at home in Berlin and I can access it through my laptop, like from my couch.\n",
      "[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  And then I can come on the satellites from there.\n",
      "[13:11.000 --> 13:16.340]  Um, and then of course we need, um, uh,\n",
      "[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  like a place where we store all the data that comes down.\n",
      "[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  So we have logs, we have telemetry, we have pictures.\n",
      "[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  Uh, and we want to make sure that all these systems are built such that we can build on top of them.\n",
      "[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  So that they all have endpoints that we can query that data, uh, with other scripts that will run on top.\n",
      "[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  Um, so those were designed from the very beginning with that on mind.\n",
      "[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  Um, yeah, and then we have a different, what we call pipeline for, for the images.\n",
      "[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  Uh, that's a different storage where, um, each of the pictures get processed and there's some quality checks in between.\n",
      "[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  All of that automated because daily we have, um, daily we download more than 15 terabytes of data.\n",
      "[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  So we have to process all that data, of course, uh, in a very automated way.\n",
      "[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Um, yeah.\n",
      "[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  And then once the images go through all that processing pipeline and image quality checks,\n",
      "[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  then they get published and delivered on a platform that are, that our customers can, can access.\n",
      "[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  Um, cool.\n",
      "[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  So how we do all of that?\n",
      "[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  Um, of course, this wasn't like the picture at the beginning.\n",
      "[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  Um, so we, we use agile aerospace on everything, but what does agile aerospace mean?\n",
      "[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  So it's on its core is rapid iteration.\n",
      "[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  Um, so on everything.\n",
      "[14:39.000 --> 14:47.000]  So from manufacturing the satellites to, um, iterating quickly on the software, the satellites are running on the software that we are running on ground.\n",
      "[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  Um, on how we do testing.\n",
      "[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  Um, so one good example of rapid iteration is, um, this doves, um, exactly.\n",
      "[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  It was actually not just one model.\n",
      "[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  Uh, so we have had more than 13 iterations over time.\n",
      "[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  Now we are past 13.\n",
      "[15:04.000 --> 15:14.000]  Um, so what we do is, um, put some new components, put the new software, um, launch a new tech demo, test it on Arbita.\n",
      "[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  And if that works, then that will become the next.\n",
      "[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  Um, the next version to launch.\n",
      "[15:19.000 --> 15:31.000]  So that's how we have been able to progress very quickly and get like always the latest and best packed into these three unique cubesat form over the years.\n",
      "[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  Um, and that also, that also happens on, um, on the software side.\n",
      "[15:36.000 --> 15:51.000]  So the way we, uh, we process the data from space operation and space operations point of view to now has changed a following that, um, that, um, agile aerospace mentality.\n",
      "[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  Um, and a key part of this when trying to do this, um, it's also always building the tools with that on mind.\n",
      "[15:58.000 --> 16:11.000]  Um, with, with having a scale, like scalability on mind, knowing that, okay, now we are operating 20 sets, but in a year we might have 200 on orbit.\n",
      "[16:11.000 --> 16:19.280]  Um, so that makes things easier and makes the system, um, just robust, um, to handle what, um, what comes on the roadmap.\n",
      "[16:21.000 --> 16:31.000]  Um, and I want to make a pause, um, talking about agile to, um, go in, get into something exciting, which is, this is also agile.\n",
      "[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Um, so to have that large number of satellites on the space, you need to launch them.\n",
      "[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  Uh, and launchers are also, uh, uh, uh, well, no, no, the market is growing, but it's, it's something that constraints, right?\n",
      "[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  There are only enough launchers in the world.\n",
      "[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  So we need to make sure that, um, we are launching as often as we need.\n",
      "[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  Um, so this is just a snapshot of what the year look like, look like for us, like the last year.\n",
      "[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  Um, so we had, uh, launches.\n",
      "[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  Thanks.\n",
      "[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Um, yeah.\n",
      "[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  So we launched from a European rocket, the Vega there.\n",
      "[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  We had 26 of our newest DOFs, which we call super DOFs.\n",
      "[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  Um, and then something interesting of that rocket is we had two different deployers.\n",
      "[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  Um, so the satellites get deployed, um, from what we call, uh, quad, quad pods.\n",
      "[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  So it's basically like boxes with a spring that, um, release the SATs.\n",
      "[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  Um, but there were two different of those systems on board.\n",
      "[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  So, uh, that was something new for us.\n",
      "[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  Um, and then we launched six of our high resolution sky sets, um, with SpaceX.\n",
      "[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  Uh, we actually had, yeah, two SpaceX launches, one electron, uh, one Vega, actually two electrons.\n",
      "[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  Um, yeah, so just, that's another part that is also agile, you know, using as many opportunities\n",
      "[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  as we can to get, uh, SATs into space.\n",
      "[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  Um, and to give you an idea of the amount of data that we have to deal with, um, the global\n",
      "[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  ground station network, um, last year collected over five petabytes of data.\n",
      "[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  Um, yeah.\n",
      "[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  And our most recent launch was actually on January.\n",
      "[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Um, I put this, cause this was very exciting.\n",
      "[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  Uh, so it was a record breaking, uh, launcher.\n",
      "[18:21.000 --> 18:29.000]  Uh, you probably have seen, um, I don't know if, well, I always see the, the live transmissions\n",
      "[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  for any, um, any rocket launch, but this was a SpaceX, uh, record breaking one.\n",
      "[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  Cause this was the most, uh, small sets ever launched altogether.\n",
      "[18:38.000 --> 18:46.000]  So 143 satellites were put all together on this rocket and they all, um, had the same ride.\n",
      "[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Um, so here we launched 48 super dogs.\n",
      "[18:49.000 --> 18:54.000]  Um, so also on two different, two different deployers.\n",
      "[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  Um, this was our 30th successful launch, um, so far.\n",
      "[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  Um, this is one of the images that, um, one of our sites that were launched on that, on\n",
      "[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  that rocket took, um, right after being commissioned.\n",
      "[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  Cool.\n",
      "[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  Um, now I'm going to talk about how they operate.\n",
      "[19:14.000 --> 19:20.000]  So the concept of operations, so that you have an idea of what we have to do as a space operations\n",
      "[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  then for automation.\n",
      "[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  Um, so our doves, um, are a monitoring mission.\n",
      "[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  So monitoring means they are always taking pictures, uh, over landmass.\n",
      "[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  Um, cause that, that's our point of interest.\n",
      "[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  Um, and then like, if they are not taking images, then they are talking to the ground stations\n",
      "[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  and downloading that data.\n",
      "[19:41.000 --> 19:48.000]  Um, and what they are not doing either of those two things, um, to be able to have them\n",
      "[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  as a line scanner separated, like in the video, we need to phase them out.\n",
      "[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  So space them out along the orbital plane.\n",
      "[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  And to do that, we use, um, differential drag maneuvers.\n",
      "[19:59.000 --> 20:04.000]  So like the satellite will be rotating so that, um, the atmospheric drag will affect\n",
      "[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  its position in relation to the others.\n",
      "[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  And they will slowly separate, uh, among the plane.\n",
      "[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  So those three things.\n",
      "[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  Uh, so it's pretty simple.\n",
      "[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  Um, well, it sounds simple.\n",
      "[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  Um, but yeah, that's basically what the sets, uh, have to do.\n",
      "[20:19.000 --> 20:26.000]  Um, and one important thing to mention is like, um, we don't do 24 seven ops.\n",
      "[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  So there's not a person that are looking what each satellite is doing all the time.\n",
      "[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  Uh, and that's because, uh, we have a lot of automation in place.\n",
      "[20:36.000 --> 20:44.000]  Um, so what we call nominal operations is, uh, basically all the tasks to make sure that the\n",
      "[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  satellite is healthy and it's doing what it's supposed to do.\n",
      "[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  So for us that, you know, it's, it's able to take pictures and it's taking pictures and\n",
      "[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  it's able to download them to the ground stations and it's downloading them.\n",
      "[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  Um, so the first thing of all is like, how do you tell the satellite what to do?\n",
      "[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  Um, so there comes the scheduler.\n",
      "[21:01.000 --> 21:13.000]  So the scheduler is, um, an optimizer building house that will every day, um, you know, uh, score, um,\n",
      "[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  uh, areas of the, of the lack of the landmass that each of the satellite can best, um, can\n",
      "[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  better take a picture of.\n",
      "[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  And then like that, uh, combined with the power budget of the satellite, we would just\n",
      "[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  distribute, um, images, imaging activities, we call them.\n",
      "[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  So it's lots where the sets are taking images to each of them, um, to the whole constellation.\n",
      "[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  And then based on like how many pictures the satellite has taken.\n",
      "[21:36.000 --> 21:41.000]  So it has a lot of other parameters and then it optimized for how to better distribute all\n",
      "[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  the available time, um, that the ground stations have.\n",
      "[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  So the scheduler will take care of doing that autonomously.\n",
      "[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  Um, it runs daily, uh, many times a day.\n",
      "[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  Um, so that's one thing.\n",
      "[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  So there doesn't have, we don't need an operator or a person like the conflicting or creating,\n",
      "[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  um, schedules for the satellites.\n",
      "[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  Um, yeah, so that's very important.\n",
      "[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  Also important, not only for the space segment, but also for the ground, um, network.\n",
      "[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  So we have, um, more than 40 antennas distributed across the world.\n",
      "[22:17.000 --> 22:24.000]  So it will be just unsustainable to have, you know, persons dedicated on each of the, in each\n",
      "[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  of the locations.\n",
      "[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  And also the, they have to act as a network.\n",
      "[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  Um, and then we need to know how each of the satellites are doing.\n",
      "[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  So once they are talking to the ground station, that data will come down.\n",
      "[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  Um, and instead of like, you know, looking at each of those, um, each of that data.\n",
      "[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  And just to give you an idea, um, our ground stations run more than 2,000 passes a day.\n",
      "[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  So, uh, yeah, it, it needs to be automated.\n",
      "[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  Um, and also the way the images are processed.\n",
      "[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  So, um, yeah.\n",
      "[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  So let me talk about what are our tasks.\n",
      "[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  So I can go more into detail on the automations.\n",
      "[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  Um, so what's the space operation?\n",
      "[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  So from the moment, um, um, you know, we have a space operation.\n",
      "[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  Um, the satellites are manufactured on ground and then they're put on a rocket and then they are launched.\n",
      "[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  So as, as soon as they leave the deployer of the rocket and they are in space, um, that's where our task starts.\n",
      "[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  Um, so we, uh, as a space ops are responsible of the commissioning of those stats commissioning means.\n",
      "[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  Making sure that all the subsystems are working as expected.\n",
      "[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Um, be tumbling the satellite.\n",
      "[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  So that's what they are deployed.\n",
      "[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  They are tumbling at a given rate.\n",
      "[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  So we want to make sure that we have, um, the attitude control, um, that we check that the radio is working, that the camera is working.\n",
      "[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  So all of that process needs to be done for each of these satellites.\n",
      "[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Um, and as soon as we can.\n",
      "[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  Um, so for that, we have also built in automations.\n",
      "[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  And actually this last launch was one of our best commissioning process.\n",
      "[24:09.000 --> 24:16.000]  So we, something that would take in the past, um, more than a week to do.\n",
      "[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  So commissioning will last like per satellite.\n",
      "[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  About seven to 10 days.\n",
      "[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  Um, we managed to achieve that, uh, to reduce that to, to less than two days.\n",
      "[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  And that's because we built in automation on board and also on ground.\n",
      "[24:33.000 --> 24:42.000]  Um, so once the satellites are commissioned and they are starting to do, you know, what they have to do, taking pictures and downloading, uh, we move into a monitoring stage.\n",
      "[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  So we have to monitor that.\n",
      "[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  And not unexpected things are happening.\n",
      "[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  That anomalies, um, are being resolved or are being caught.\n",
      "[24:50.000 --> 24:55.520]  Um, and then at the same time, as part of our, um,\n",
      "[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  Agile Aerospace, we will, um, continuously test things on orbit.\n",
      "[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  So we call them experiments or test things.\n",
      "[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  Um, so obviously we have, um, testing on ground.\n",
      "[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  So we have satellites on, on ground where we test things first, but we also test things on space.\n",
      "[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  So we have, uh, we call them canaries.\n",
      "[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  So they're like the, um, or staging sats.\n",
      "[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  That's where we will test something first to make sure that everything's fine and then roll to the hoof.\n",
      "[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  Um, and then anomaly debugging, of course.\n",
      "[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  So when something comes up and we need to fix it, uh, we need to look into it.\n",
      "[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  Um, but we are also working towards making these more autonomously.\n",
      "[25:37.000 --> 25:46.000]  Um, then yeah, uh, software, uh, we continuously update the software that is running on board the satellite.\n",
      "[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  Um, so that's a big part of testing on ground and also testing on orbit.\n",
      "[25:50.000 --> 25:57.000]  And then when the satellites reach their end of life, then there's a retirement process.\n",
      "[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  Uh, but it doesn't end there.\n",
      "[25:59.000 --> 26:07.000]  So once the satellite is no longer productive and we have had to retire it, there's a lot of data from that satellite.\n",
      "[26:07.000 --> 26:16.000]  So from their whole lifetime and that, that data will help us create models, degradation models or forecast models.\n",
      "[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  Um, what to expect from next, uh, from next generation satellites.\n",
      "[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  All right.\n",
      "[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  So, um, moving into how a space operations change, uh, with the amount of satellites.\n",
      "[26:28.000 --> 26:37.000]  Um, so obviously some years ago we had attend even, um, probably a bit less now of the, of the amounts of satellites that we have now.\n",
      "[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Um, although mission control was built in for scalability, there have been, um, already many iterations.\n",
      "[26:44.000 --> 26:57.000]  So, but the, the principal, the principal, uh, feature was that we wanted to have a mission control that will be able to talk to the ground stations and handle, um, the communication with the satellites on its own.\n",
      "[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  So that was a, uh, key stepping stone.\n",
      "[27:00.000 --> 27:13.000]  Um, and then the first satellites that we launched, um, were, uh, a way of us, uh, a way for us as a space operations to learn, um, you know, like what they're doing.\n",
      "[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  You know, like what data we should be looking at.\n",
      "[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  So basically gather operational experience.\n",
      "[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  Um, so initially what, what our job look like, what's going through, uh, reports.\n",
      "[27:25.000 --> 27:32.000]  So logs that, um, capture things that were happening on ground or things that were happening, um, on board the satellite.\n",
      "[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  Um, and then we'll have some sort of, um, scripting that will filter or group things, um, like similar warnings or similar captures.\n",
      "[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  And then we'll, we'll have that summary per satellite.\n",
      "[27:43.000 --> 27:52.000]  And then, um, an operator or one of us will have to look into each of those alerts and then, um, understand or understand the root cause and then come up with a mitigation.\n",
      "[27:52.000 --> 28:04.000]  Um, so we will look at that daily per set, but of course, um, as the number of sets increased, that became, um, unsustainable.\n",
      "[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  Um, yeah, it was time consuming.\n",
      "[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Uh, you need to evaluate every alert.\n",
      "[28:12.000 --> 28:19.000]  And as we were constantly iterating, there were new, um, new things or new features on the satellite.\n",
      "[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  So there were different performance value across satellites.\n",
      "[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  And of course, as the number increased, there was more data to parse through.\n",
      "[28:26.000 --> 28:34.000]  So, um, I remember there were days where like it took us half a day, half a working day to go through all of the alerts.\n",
      "[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  Um, and now it takes us less than an hour.\n",
      "[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  Um, so what changed?\n",
      "[28:44.000 --> 28:55.000]  So we had to move from the, uh, traditional space operations mentality of let's look at what happens with each individual set to what do we expect from the whole fleet?\n",
      "[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  Um, so we shift that, uh, on our minds and say, okay, let's first look at the value of the constellation.\n",
      "[29:02.000 --> 29:12.000]  So what is important is that as a whole, as a group, these satellites have to deliver this amount of data and they have to download it, uh, within this time.\n",
      "[29:12.000 --> 29:22.000]  So what we look at now, it's, um, we build, uh, metrics with scripts, uh, that will aggregate that data for us.\n",
      "[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  And that will be the first indicator.\n",
      "[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  If the fleet as a whole, um, it's operating as it should.\n",
      "[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  Um, and then if not, then we know there is a fleet wide issue.\n",
      "[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  And then we have built alerting systems for those metrics that matter the most to us.\n",
      "[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  Uh, and we will only react to those alerts then.\n",
      "[29:42.000 --> 29:50.000]  And then the second layer is identifying, um, the doves or the sets, um, on the fleet that have some non-nominal behavior.\n",
      "[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  Uh, but we don't want to do that by looking at each of them.\n",
      "[29:53.000 --> 29:56.000]  So what we want is for the metrics to tell us.\n",
      "[29:57.000 --> 30:01.000]  Uh, we, we expect this, uh, performance from the set.\n",
      "[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Uh, but there has been this deviation.\n",
      "[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  And then we just want to see the alert.\n",
      "[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  And we want to see the alert on the specific thing that we have to look at.\n",
      "[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  Um, so that's what we have now.\n",
      "[30:12.000 --> 30:20.000]  And then the next step is like, okay, now we know, um, this alert on this specific issue has popped up.\n",
      "[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  How do we mitigate this?\n",
      "[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  Uh, so once we have the mitigation, but we want the next time this happens that we have a script on top.\n",
      "[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  We have a script that detects the issue.\n",
      "[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  And then we have a script that just applies the resolution automatically.\n",
      "[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  So without us knowing, but of course we, we want to have visibility on how many times this happens.\n",
      "[30:38.000 --> 30:44.000]  So we make sure to be metrics around everything, our automations, um, on the performance.\n",
      "[30:44.000 --> 30:55.000]  Um, so by doing this, we optimize the system availability and the capacity because, uh, there is less engineering time spent at looking at individual things.\n",
      "[30:55.000 --> 31:02.000]  Um, investing in automation, freeze up a lot of our time on that, and then makes the responses way quicker.\n",
      "[31:02.000 --> 31:10.000]  And so rather than a person looking through something and then some, there's some delay time between like, okay, coming up with the response and applying the response.\n",
      "[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  The, um, the automation is just taking care of that, taking care of that immediately.\n",
      "[31:15.000 --> 31:21.000]  Um, so that has been, that has been a great positive change.\n",
      "[31:21.000 --> 31:27.000]  Um, so yeah, I took a lot about metrics.\n",
      "[31:27.000 --> 31:36.000]  Um, so, I mean, this is a very simple diagram of what we have in place, um, as a space operations, uh, but it's basically that.\n",
      "[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  So we have the different, uh, entities of the system.\n",
      "[31:39.000 --> 31:47.000]  So we have mission control that has data, uh, from each of the satellites and each of the ground stations.\n",
      "[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  Uh, we have orbit data from the sides.\n",
      "[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  We have telemetry, we have logs.\n",
      "[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  Um, all of these data is stored in such way that we can, um,\n",
      "[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  that we have endpoints to query that data from.\n",
      "[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  So it's easy for us, um, to build the scripts on top.\n",
      "[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  Um, we use Python for this.\n",
      "[32:03.000 --> 32:14.000]  We have a lot of, um, scripts that like a, uh, group of them that we call mission metrics that will tell us everything from the high level.\n",
      "[32:14.000 --> 32:23.000]  Performance of the, of the fleet to like specific, um, performance data per satellite and per subsystem.\n",
      "[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  So it just gives us the granularity that we need.\n",
      "[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  And also it abstracts to, um, true high level metrics.\n",
      "[32:30.000 --> 32:35.000]  Um, and then we, we can decide how to use this data.\n",
      "[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  That's the right thing.\n",
      "[32:36.000 --> 32:44.000]  So we can, from there, you know, use those aggregated records and then build automated responses on top.\n",
      "[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  Do analysis on, do analysis on, on Python notebooks or simply like display the data on visual ways.\n",
      "[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  Like using tools like Grafana or Kibana.\n",
      "[32:53.000 --> 33:01.000]  Um, so it just, it's just like a very powerful, uh, way of, um, using data analysis on any issue that can come up.\n",
      "[33:01.000 --> 33:06.000]  Um, yeah.\n",
      "[33:06.000 --> 33:07.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[33:07.000 --> 33:22.000]  So over the years, and I would say, especially the last two years or so, um, yeah, the, the role of the space subs operator, um, has been taken over by the automation.\n",
      "[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  Um, so, um, we, we call it out the world, but it's not, it's, that's why the, the logo here, uh, but the, the automation has taken that role.\n",
      "[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  Uh, so it takes care of the common anomalies, um, and maximize the performance of the fleet.\n",
      "[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  Um, cool.\n",
      "[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  Um, this is one specific example of one of the automations.\n",
      "[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  Uh, this might be going into too much detail.\n",
      "[33:48.000 --> 33:51.020]  And actually one of my colleagues talked about it.\n",
      "[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  Um, about this specific use case.\n",
      "[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  Well, PI data about more than a year ago now.\n",
      "[33:57.000 --> 34:07.000]  So maybe it's time for us to do another deep dive on this, but, um, this is just one clear example of where automation is, um, is just very important.\n",
      "[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  Um, so, uh, we use, we use a job that, um, sets that on the duty cycle on each satellite.\n",
      "[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  So the duty cycle is how many times in a day the satellite will spend imaging, uh, the earth.\n",
      "[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  So it only can do so much cause there's only so, so much land to, to take pictures of.\n",
      "[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  And also cause there's only so much power.\n",
      "[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  Um, so the power depends, uh, cause we have solar panels.\n",
      "[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  The power depends on, um, the sun, the sun beta angle.\n",
      "[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  So across the stations in a year, um, that angle changes.\n",
      "[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  Um, so we want to make sure that our power models and the duty cycle includes that change.\n",
      "[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  So the lower the red angle, the lower illumination the panels have.\n",
      "[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  So, um, the, the lower the power it's available to the satellite.\n",
      "[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  So we want to make sure that we know that and the satellite knows that.\n",
      "[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  So that is not overdoing itself.\n",
      "[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  Like it's not trying to take more pictures with the power that it doesn't have.\n",
      "[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  Um, so this is obviously, um, it's, it will make sense to do this manually.\n",
      "[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  I'm like checking every time of the year when we have to change these.\n",
      "[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  So basically that's what an automation is doing is just, um, checking the power telemetry saying,\n",
      "[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  okay, this, the, the voltages on board look, look okay.\n",
      "[35:33.000 --> 35:38.000]  If there is a deep and a flag has triggered on the power system, then it will say,\n",
      "[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Oh, you are doing, you're doing much more than what you need to do.\n",
      "[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  So let's reduce your cycle.\n",
      "[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  So it's doing that tuning for us.\n",
      "[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  And by doing that, we are keeping the satellite healthy.\n",
      "[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  And we are also making sure that, uh, when we have a lot of power, we are imaging as much as we can.\n",
      "[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  Um, and when not, we are dialing, dialing it back.\n",
      "[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  Um, cool.\n",
      "[36:00.000 --> 36:12.000]  So yeah, that's just one example of the many things that we have to control, but, uh, that are just made easy by having, uh, ready available metrics that we can aggregate in any way we can.\n",
      "[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  Um, yeah.\n",
      "[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  And then build on top of that.\n",
      "[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  So what's next?\n",
      "[36:20.000 --> 36:30.000]  Um, so we have reached that point where we feel comfortable with, um, you know, like the, the, the, the detection and mitigation and the metrics that we have.\n",
      "[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  Uh, and now we are trying to explore with machine learning applications.\n",
      "[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  So we have all this data already aggregated in many ways.\n",
      "[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  Um, so what we are trying to discover is how we can, um, make, make use of that historical data altogether.\n",
      "[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  Um, so what we have on mind, like, um, maybe in the longterm it's, uh, being able to predict the anomalies.\n",
      "[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  So we know some signatures, um, we have the data of all the subsystems.\n",
      "[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  Um, we, we also have operator data when an anomaly has happened, like as an operator, as a human, what, what are the things you have to look at?\n",
      "[37:08.000 --> 37:24.000]  Um, so training the, training those data sets with that, um, might help us, um, be more predictive, uh, and also predict, uh, performance degradation.\n",
      "[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  So we know, okay, um, we have a better model for forecasting.\n",
      "[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  Uh, and eventually, um, just having an autonomous fleet, um, that requires no human in the loop.\n",
      "[37:37.000 --> 37:44.000]  Um, that's like the ultimate goal, but, um, yeah, uh, we're not there yet, but those are some next steps.\n",
      "[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  Um, cool.\n",
      "[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  And I wanted to end, cause I talk a lot about space and launches, but, um, why is this important?\n",
      "[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  So abstracting a bit from the technical side of things.\n",
      "[37:55.000 --> 38:05.000]  Um, and actually these are some applications that, you know, where, where Python or, or, um, any type of data analysis is super powerful.\n",
      "[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  Uh, it's to play, not to play, but to actually use the data that comes down from the satellites.\n",
      "[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  Um, so to me, this is a very, oops, sorry.\n",
      "[38:13.000 --> 38:21.000]  Uh, this is a very powerful, uh, video that shows what can be observed.\n",
      "[38:22.000 --> 38:32.000]  Um, so this is data from, um, this is an image from the Amazon, uh, forest from 2017, uh, to last year.\n",
      "[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  So, cause we have daily images.\n",
      "[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  You can see how things change across time.\n",
      "[38:39.000 --> 38:51.000]  Um, yeah, so it's just, uh, I think it's just powerful and it's something, um, that adds this visibility that we didn't have before.\n",
      "[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  Um, yeah, you can see the deforestation, how it's increasing across the days.\n",
      "[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[38:59.000 --> 39:10.000]  I mean, it's very sad, but yeah, this is a really good example of the impact that our data can make.\n",
      "[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  And of the applications of earth observation imagery in general.\n",
      "[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  Um, cool.\n",
      "[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  Thanks.\n",
      "[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  Um, of course, uh, there's some time for questions.\n",
      "[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  I think I might have extended myself a bit, but if you are excited about what we do about space, um, anything space operations, data analytics, um, you know, we are hiring a lot.\n",
      "[39:32.000 --> 39:42.000]  So check out our career pages or let me know if you want to know more.\n",
      "[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  Thanks.\n",
      "[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  So.\n",
      "[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  Thanks a lot, Katia.\n",
      "[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  That's very interesting.\n",
      "[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  I mean, I'm biased.\n",
      "[39:47.000 --> 40:03.000]  Um, we'll do, uh, Theo or Noah help me with the questions.\n",
      "[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  We have questions both in YouTube and I guess here.\n",
      "[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  I, please write your question in the chat.\n",
      "[40:13.000 --> 40:21.000]  If you have any, um, we have a question from YouTube, which, uh, what is the lifespan of these satellites from launch to their retirement?\n",
      "[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  So the design life is up to three years.\n",
      "[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  Uh, but we have definitely seen sets that have, uh, live more than that.\n",
      "[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  I see a question.\n",
      "[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  Are there images available to the public?\n",
      "[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Um, there are two different programs.\n",
      "[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  Um, so just, uh, recently we signed, uh, um, an agreement with the Norway government.\n",
      "[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  It's called NIFKI.\n",
      "[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  Um, so that's, uh, opening data for, uh, forests around the world.\n",
      "[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  Um, so there, there are different ways where the data can be shared.\n",
      "[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  Um, I encourage you to visit our website for more info.\n",
      "[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  Another one.\n",
      "[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  Yes.\n",
      "[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  Go.\n",
      "[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  Assuming this is open data, are you tracking who is using these images?\n",
      "[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  It would be nice to see the applications.\n",
      "[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  Another one.\n",
      "[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  Yes.\n",
      "[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  Go.\n",
      "[41:17.000 --> 41:24.000]  Um, well, for the, we definitely have a research program.\n",
      "[41:24.000 --> 41:31.000]  Um, where universities do different, um, studies and, uh, like applications with our data.\n",
      "[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  And those are, uh, available through paper and scientific publications.\n",
      "[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  Um, I'm not sure if we have that, um, like listed or grouped on our website, but I'm sure\n",
      "[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  if you, um, search for that on the internet, just papers and scientific publications, you\n",
      "[41:47.000 --> 41:52.300]  will find, uh, some of them, not many of them.\n",
      "[41:54.000 --> 42:05.000]  Um, controlling a world satellite fleet from a couch is awesome, but does it bring additional\n",
      "[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  security risks?\n",
      "[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  Yeah, of course.\n",
      "[42:11.000 --> 42:21.000]  Um, our, um, security team makes sure that, you know, there are all the, um, security measures\n",
      "[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  in place so that we can be able to do this.\n",
      "[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  So it's not as easy as going to the website, for instance, but they make our systems easy\n",
      "[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  to, uh, to work with.\n",
      "[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  For us.\n",
      "[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  Cool.\n",
      "[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  Um, I think there's no more.\n",
      "[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  Oh, no.\n",
      "[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  There's no other question.\n",
      "[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  So thanks again, Katia.\n",
      "[42:48.000 --> 42:50.260]  It was very interesting.\n",
      "[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  Thanks Valentina.\n",
      "[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  Thanks everyone for inviting me.\n",
      "[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  Thank you.\n",
      "[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Uh, I think we will have a five minutes break.\n",
      "[43:01.000 --> 43:08.000]  It's for someone who needs to, I dunno, go to the bathroom or whatever.\n",
      "[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  And then we will proceed.\n",
      "[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  So, uh, right now it's, uh, 747.\n",
      "[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  So let's meet in, uh, let's keep it round.\n",
      "[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  Uh, let's meet in, uh, 55 if it's okay.\n",
      "[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  So you can all grab a beer if you want or soda or go to the toilet or kebab, whatever you\n",
      "[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  want.\n",
      "[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  Does someone have a joke?\n",
      "[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  A joke?\n",
      "[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  No one.\n",
      "[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[43:36.000 --> 43:58.000]  So because we're in PI data, I have to use PI joke, which is the pip library that you\n",
      "[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  can install.\n",
      "[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  So how to explain the movie Inception to a programmer.\n",
      "[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  When you run a VM inside another VM, inside another VM, everything runs really slow.\n",
      "[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  Still two minutes.\n",
      "[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  I really, really advise to install this library.\n",
      "[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  Very useful.\n",
      "[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  Last one before we go.\n",
      "[44:27.000 --> 44:35.000]  Um, the child, dad, why does the sun rise in the east and set in the west?\n",
      "[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  Dad, son, it's working.\n",
      "[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  Don't touch it.\n",
      "[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  That was better.\n",
      "[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  Almost funny.\n",
      "[44:43.000 --> 44:45.680]  I do my best.\n",
      "[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  55.\n",
      "[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  So I think we can start.\n",
      "[44:53.000 --> 45:04.000]  So let's, uh, welcome for the second part, um, with, uh, Nilandri, um, who will talk about\n",
      "[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  an overview of deepfakes.\n",
      "[45:05.000 --> 45:12.000]  Uh, so he's working as a data scientist at Sentinel, uh, where he works with government and security\n",
      "[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  agency to defense against deepfakes and information welfare.\n",
      "[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  So Nilandri, you're done.\n",
      "[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  You, you are muted.\n",
      "[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  We don't hear you for the moment.\n",
      "[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  Sorry.\n",
      "[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  Sorry.\n",
      "[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  Sorry.\n",
      "[45:30.000 --> 45:31.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Uh, can you hear me now?\n",
      "[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  Yes.\n",
      "[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  Great.\n",
      "[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  Uh, hello.\n",
      "[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  Good evening, everyone.\n",
      "[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  And thanks to PyData Berlin for having me.\n",
      "[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  Today, I'll be talking about deepfakes or why I have trust issues.\n",
      "[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  Uh, so let's begin.\n",
      "[45:52.000 --> 45:59.000]  Uh, so, uh, one thing I've heard and sure all of you have heard as well is that a picture\n",
      "[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  is worth a thousand words, but, uh, what if that picture is actually fake?\n",
      "[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  So then what does it say?\n",
      "[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  It turns out it actually says more and based on whom and where you ask, uh, it could contain\n",
      "[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  a lot of misinformation.\n",
      "[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  So, uh, let's look at this picture.\n",
      "[46:17.000 --> 46:22.000]  Uh, and this picture is, looks very much like a human, but it's completely fake.\n",
      "[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  And it's been generated, uh, by an AI program.\n",
      "[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  Uh, so if you look at this website called this person does not exist.com.\n",
      "[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  So like every time you go there, it will generate a fake image.\n",
      "[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  And, uh, turns out that there are a ton of these sites and based on, uh, what do you\n",
      "[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  like?\n",
      "[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  I'm sure there's something for everyone starting from this.\n",
      "[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  This mean does not exist.\n",
      "[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  The startup does not exist.\n",
      "[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  And also for cat fans, this cat does not exist.\n",
      "[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  So, you know, there's a lot of things.\n",
      "[46:51.000 --> 46:56.000]  Um, you know, that's where my trust issues, you know, kind of, you know, begin.\n",
      "[46:56.000 --> 47:01.000]  So let's look at this, uh, defect, which has been circulated by, uh, um, you know, it's\n",
      "[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  becoming very popular this month.\n",
      "[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  And it's a deep fake of Tom Cruise.\n",
      "[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  Uh, that's why.\n",
      "[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  Oh.\n",
      "[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  Hey.\n",
      "[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  What's up?\n",
      "[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  Haha.\n",
      "[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  Just, oh.\n",
      "[47:15.000 --> 47:23.000]  It's a little, uh, embarrassing, you know, it reminds me, there was once in Russia.\n",
      "[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  I ran into, uh, Gorbachev.\n",
      "[47:27.000 --> 47:28.000]  Haha.\n",
      "[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  He said, you know, Mr. Movie Star.\n",
      "[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  He's a daughter.\n",
      "[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  What are you gonna do with this?\n",
      "[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  TikTok.\n",
      "[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  You guys cool if I play some sports?\n",
      "[47:42.000 --> 47:50.000]  As you can see, like, this is the state of the back of 2020.\n",
      "[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  Uh, in 2021, uh, this is what you can do.\n",
      "[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  Uh, but it's not all fun, uh, because, uh, defects cause a lot of problems.\n",
      "[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  And, uh, there was this incident where a journalist was, uh, investigating or rather exposing a sex\n",
      "[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  child, uh, sorry, child sex abuse case.\n",
      "[48:09.000 --> 48:16.000]  And, uh, to silence her, they started with the misinformation campaign about some fake tweets.\n",
      "[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  And, uh, when she didn't stop, so they launched, uh, defake porn of her.\n",
      "[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  And that, uh, kind of had a very, you know, big, big effect on her.\n",
      "[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  And starting with describing her as a journalist, and it ended quite badly.\n",
      "[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  And this is not that uncommon.\n",
      "[48:37.000 --> 48:48.000]  So, uh, you can see a lot of these defects, uh, being used to essentially, um, alter public\n",
      "[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  opinion, starting with a defect of a Belgian premier talking about that, uh, climate crisis\n",
      "[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  is imminent and linking that to COVID.\n",
      "[48:57.000 --> 49:02.000]  And, uh, you also have other cases where in India, there was, uh, a BGP leader, uh, that\n",
      "[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  was a political party, uh, trying to reach out to their voters, uh, in their local language.\n",
      "[49:07.000 --> 49:15.000]  And the audio was generated, uh, was, uh, used by, uh, was generated by NEI.\n",
      "[49:15.000 --> 49:22.000]  And, uh, right now the, uh, like before the entry to use the rather the entry barrier to\n",
      "[49:22.000 --> 49:28.000]  use, uh, the fake technology was kind of like only like, uh, experts could use it, let's\n",
      "[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  say, uh, but that has been going down.\n",
      "[49:30.000 --> 49:37.000]  So we have been seeing the rise of, uh, defects as a technical barrier to creating them goes\n",
      "[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  down.\n",
      "[49:38.000 --> 49:44.000]  So right now the true estimation is, uh, around a hundred million plus defects in 2021.\n",
      "[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  And a lot of them have to do with the easy to use apps.\n",
      "[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  So there's this very popular app called, uh, uh, reface.\n",
      "[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Uh, you might've heard of it.\n",
      "[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Uh, it actually was trending at one point.\n",
      "[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Like it was trending at a number one in entertainment.\n",
      "[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  It also beat, uh, TikTok.\n",
      "[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  So, uh, it allows you to, uh, to easily create the fake videos.\n",
      "[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  And, uh, this was a news article, which I read yesterday.\n",
      "[50:08.000 --> 50:15.000]  It was a mother, uh, uh, using the fake to actually frame her daughter's, uh, rivals that,\n",
      "[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  uh, they were doing, uh, like essentially create a fake video of their rivals.\n",
      "[50:21.000 --> 50:28.000]  So it's, as, as you can see, it's no longer, you know, uh, just being useful to defame, uh,\n",
      "[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  celebrities are used to, for political agendas.\n",
      "[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  It could, the next victim could be you or me.\n",
      "[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  So this is, has like, probably like that now is like the tipping point.\n",
      "[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  So the cost of disinformation annually as estimated in 2019, it was around 78 billion.\n",
      "[50:45.000 --> 50:51.000]  And, uh, the most alarming thing is that false stories actually reach six times faster compared\n",
      "[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  to true stories.\n",
      "[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  So the, uh, the infiltration, uh, if you launch a defect is much faster.\n",
      "[50:58.000 --> 51:05.000]  Uh, so now let's look at a few types of defect.\n",
      "[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  So the first one is face swapping.\n",
      "[51:07.000 --> 51:13.000]  Uh, so what happens is that you have a source face, uh, this is original and the target face.\n",
      "[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  Uh, and, uh, the BI model kind of learns, uh, what are the facial features of the source\n",
      "[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  and the target are, and essentially swaps these and creates a superimposition to manipulate,\n",
      "[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  uh, a face swap defake.\n",
      "[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  And then you have the second type, which is facial reenactment.\n",
      "[51:31.000 --> 51:38.000]  So, uh, what happens is that, uh, you have the source video and, uh, and the target.\n",
      "[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  So, uh, you can like, for example, make, uh, facial movements or speak anything you want.\n",
      "[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  And that will kind of be mimicked on, uh, the target face.\n",
      "[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  So you could make any person say anything that you want.\n",
      "[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  And this is kind of a pretty dangerous, right?\n",
      "[51:54.000 --> 52:02.000]  Uh, you can also have full body defects where you essentially move the targets, uh, entire body to whatever pose you like.\n",
      "[52:02.000 --> 52:16.000]  And then the fourth category, of course, which is audio defect, uh, where you can generate, uh, an audio, which is being, uh, uh, like, uh, may make a person's voice.\n",
      "[52:16.000 --> 52:29.000]  So there was this case where, uh, company CEO was, uh, uh, so a defect of the company CEO was used to mimic a wire transfer of around $243,000.\n",
      "[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  And, uh, this has been a rising problem.\n",
      "[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  So let's look at this video.\n",
      "[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  I'm not going to say to you if this is, uh, fake or real.\n",
      "[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  Uh, let's see how you can probably figure this out.\n",
      "[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  When Mexico sends its people.\n",
      "[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.\n",
      "[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  They're not sending you.\n",
      "[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  They're not sending you.\n",
      "[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  They're sending people that have lots of problems.\n",
      "[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  And they're bringing those problems with us.\n",
      "[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  They're bringing drugs.\n",
      "[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  They're bringing crime.\n",
      "[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  They're rapists.\n",
      "[53:10.000 --> 53:17.000]  So, uh, maybe, you know, if you've seen this, uh, if it's a fake or not a real.\n",
      "[53:17.000 --> 53:24.000]  So, and that's, you, you know, where the trust issue really starts to begin, where you even start to doubt what's a real video.\n",
      "[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And you think probably that's a fake.\n",
      "[53:26.000 --> 53:39.000]  So it's kind of, uh, when Mexico sends its people, they're not sending.\n",
      "[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  And, uh, the trust issues start to increase and, uh, probably like to the moon.\n",
      "[53:46.000 --> 53:56.000]  So there was, uh, this, uh, um, report published by, uh, Republican hub, uh, Republican candidate.\n",
      "[53:56.000 --> 54:06.000]  And, uh, he claimed that, uh, the George Floyd's death incident was, uh, completely fake and, uh, digitally manipulated using the fake.\n",
      "[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Now that that's of course, uh, false.\n",
      "[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  But, uh, it's that just because, uh, you there, just because the fake exists, it kind of puts into jeopardy.\n",
      "[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  The entire, uh, like a real video might be called as, you know, it's the fake.\n",
      "[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  It doesn't exist.\n",
      "[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  You probably just create created it.\n",
      "[54:26.000 --> 54:41.000]  So, uh, some of the trust issues are like, uh, you know, the fake can be used to, uh, cause fraud, uh, espionage inside mental or physical harm.\n",
      "[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  Like we saw in case, uh, of the, uh, journalist.\n",
      "[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  And we have been seeing, uh, increase in, uh, these kinds of crimes, uh, particularly against women.\n",
      "[54:50.000 --> 54:58.000]  Uh, where someone's, uh, says are rather black males that a person's, uh, defake, uh, porn might be used.\n",
      "[54:58.000 --> 55:10.000]  Uh, and, uh, there are of course other, uh, aspects to it, like, uh, influencing judicial proceedings to the point of actually threatening national integrity and security.\n",
      "[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  So what does, what does the future hold?\n",
      "[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  Uh, so now, right now we have, uh, AI generated, uh, text.\n",
      "[55:19.000 --> 55:26.000]  So like there's a very popular model called GPT-3, which can be used to generate any kind of text that you want.\n",
      "[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  And now you have, uh, defigs to generate any kind of video or GANs to generate any kind of image.\n",
      "[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  So you essentially have all the tools to generate whatever event you want, and you can do that at scale.\n",
      "[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  And thus you can manipulate, uh, opinion and essentially spread misinformation.\n",
      "[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  So how does defig work?\n",
      "[55:47.000 --> 55:57.000]  So, uh, one of the most popular approaches used in defig is by using something called as autoencoders.\n",
      "[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  So in an autoencoder architecture, there is typically three blocks.\n",
      "[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  So one is the encoder.\n",
      "[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  Uh, one is the bottleneck and you have the decoder.\n",
      "[56:06.000 --> 56:19.000]  So the encoders job is essentially to encode information, uh, like an image, which is a high, uh, it's a high dimensional representation into a low representation or rather encoded, which is stored in the bottleneck.\n",
      "[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  And the decoder decodes that information again to, uh, that previous image.\n",
      "[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  So usually the decoder just reconstructs the, tries to reconstruct that input.\n",
      "[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  Now with the autoencoders, you can do multiple things.\n",
      "[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  And one of them is, uh, you can create, uh, fake images or anything you want.\n",
      "[56:38.000 --> 56:48.000]  So how you can use autoencoders to, uh, you know, essentially create defigs is that you have this encoder block, which is, uh, kind of, uh, shared.\n",
      "[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  So, uh, we'll actually need two, uh, autoencoders for, uh, creating defects.\n",
      "[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  So, uh, so the first part is, uh, the top part, which you see is the source image and the bottom is the target.\n",
      "[57:02.000 --> 57:09.000]  So the source images, uh, we could be yourself and the target is that whatever you want to impose, uh, like, uh, target person.\n",
      "[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  Let's say you want to swap, uh, Donald Trump's image on, uh, Alec Baldwin.\n",
      "[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  So Alec Baldwin here is the target and Donald Trump here is the source.\n",
      "[57:18.000 --> 57:25.000]  So, uh, in this architecture, uh, the encoder is actually, it's the same for both the source and the target.\n",
      "[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  And, uh, we have two separate decoders.\n",
      "[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  So, uh, for the source, um, input to, we are going to encode it.\n",
      "[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  And again, decode it exactly, uh, to Donald Trump's, uh, image.\n",
      "[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  And for the, um, uh, target, we are going to do the same.\n",
      "[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  And this is what happens in the training pad.\n",
      "[57:45.000 --> 57:59.000]  And when you want to actually generate, uh, the, the, let's say a defig, what you're going to do is let's say use the encoder part for, uh, for Donald Trump's image and use the decoder part for Alec Baldwin's.\n",
      "[57:59.000 --> 58:11.000]  So what you have, uh, here is that by using, uh, like the source from the encoder and the decoder part for the targets, you essentially kind of swap, uh, the faces.\n",
      "[58:11.000 --> 58:17.000]  Now, uh, this is not exactly like state-of-the-art stuff because, uh, there's a lot of artifacts usually present.\n",
      "[58:17.000 --> 58:23.000]  And, uh, with the previous approach, uh, you will need like pairs of, uh, videos.\n",
      "[58:23.000 --> 58:33.000]  So it would, uh, require a lot of training and you can't exactly use that, uh, for like inference or like testing whenever you want.\n",
      "[58:33.000 --> 58:40.000]  So you will need a lot of, uh, data to create someone's defect, but technology has been improving since then.\n",
      "[58:40.000 --> 58:46.000]  So you have this, uh, something, an architecture called FSCAN, which is kind of subject agnostic.\n",
      "[58:46.000 --> 58:52.000]  And what that means is that you do not, uh, need, uh, you know, a pairwise training.\n",
      "[58:52.000 --> 59:00.000]  So, uh, so if you do not have a source, uh, on a target video, uh, um, like a training data of it.\n",
      "[59:00.000 --> 59:08.000]  So, uh, you can still use this because, uh, when you actually want to use this, um, uh, sort of architecture to create your own defect,\n",
      "[59:08.000 --> 59:14.000]  you do not need to gather a lot of data and need a pairs of source image and target video.\n",
      "[59:16.000 --> 59:21.000]  So how does this work is by using something called as the generative adversarial network.\n",
      "[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  Uh, then the way it works is that you have two blocks.\n",
      "[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  Essentially one is the generator and another is the discriminator.\n",
      "[59:27.000 --> 59:34.000]  The generators, uh, essentially creates, uh, uh, no fake images.\n",
      "[59:34.000 --> 59:42.000]  And the discriminator's job is to, um, try to differentiate between the real images and fake images.\n",
      "[59:42.000 --> 59:51.000]  And the discriminator does this really well at first, but ultimately the generator actually manages to fool the discriminator into thinking that the fake image is a real image.\n",
      "[59:51.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  And by generating these kind of, uh, uh, you know, uh, this sort of a training procedure, we're actually able to create, uh, fake images, which are very, uh, lifelike.\n",
      "[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  Uh, such kind of sort of the stuff that you saw in the beginning, uh, very, very Freudian image of a fake person.\n",
      "[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  So how does this work in FS scan is that, uh, for example, if you have the source and you have the target, uh, what you calculate first is kind of like landmarks.\n",
      "[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  So these, so these would be guiding face landmarks.\n",
      "[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  So a landmark is essentially, uh, what you see on the left over here.\n",
      "[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  And, uh, so it contains, uh, you know, points to, uh, your face, uh, and it picks out like, uh, very specific, uh, and important features of your face, which can be used to represent.\n",
      "[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  So, uh, in this first part, you have these guys sort of guiding face landmarks.\n",
      "[01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  And, uh, this will be used, uh, to kind of, uh, first, uh, be passed to a generator to, first of all, align this, uh, source face into sort of the way the target's face is, uh, uh, looking at.\n",
      "[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  So the, so the first thing which happens over here is the post correction.\n",
      "[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And, uh, over here, uh, the target space will be, uh, passed, uh, another generator, which kind of separates, uh, all these.\n",
      "[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Um, uh, like separates the various, uh, parts of the face.\n",
      "[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  So you have the face separated out and the other parts of the image will be, again, separate out like the hair or a urine or something like that.\n",
      "[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  And then essentially, uh, uh, we'd be kind of, uh, using the landmarks, which we got to essentially train, uh, our generator.\n",
      "[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  To, uh, essentially make, uh, generate images, uh, uh, essentially gets, uh, sort of like how the movement of the faces, uh, working.\n",
      "[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  So we have multiple images.\n",
      "[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  So if it's a video, we can extract them multiple frames and we get, uh, a lot of these, uh, landmarks.\n",
      "[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  So that's why you have multiple landmarks.\n",
      "[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  And once, and if you interpolate between them, um, you can get an idea of how to move the source or rather than, uh, to, to move the object objects.\n",
      "[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  So, uh, uh, kind of the sources of face in a way the target's face is moving.\n",
      "[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  And once you have that, you can, uh, uh, do something called as in painting.\n",
      "[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  So typically, uh, once we have this image, uh, you can see like a lot of parts on this image are kind of, uh, not completed.\n",
      "[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  And this is very typical because you will always have partial occlusions.\n",
      "[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  And that can be filled up by an in painting, uh, network, which essentially fills up this, uh, image, uh, by picking up detail from the target face.\n",
      "[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  So whatever, uh, you know, missing features are from the source, you can probably pick it up on the target's face and create something and complete this image.\n",
      "[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  And the last part is the blending part where the source, uh, faces.\n",
      "[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  So, you know, really blended well to the target's face to the point of looking like, uh, you know, very lifelike.\n",
      "[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  And, uh, this is, uh, open source, so you can try this out.\n",
      "[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Uh, it's present in the GitHub repository of the paper, which is called FSGAN.\n",
      "[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  And they also have a Colab notebook, so you can try it out really fast.\n",
      "[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  So let's, uh, look at how you can actually spot a fake image.\n",
      "[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  And this will be a manual procedure.\n",
      "[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  So over here we can see, uh, image.\n",
      "[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  And this was released by North Korea's, uh, central news agency.\n",
      "[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  And they were trying to, uh, show a military exercise where North Korea's, uh, hovercrafts, uh, sorry, hovercrafts, uh, were, uh, were landing on the east coast.\n",
      "[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  So, and over here you can see it like, uh, they have multiple, uh, hovercrafts here.\n",
      "[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And it's actually a fake image.\n",
      "[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  So over here, if you see, uh, this, uh, left, um, block.\n",
      "[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  And if you compare it with the right block, you'll see that it looks exactly similar.\n",
      "[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  So this was, uh, essentially a copy paste of the, um, of this object over here.\n",
      "[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  And, uh, similarly, if you look at a few finer details, like, uh, the ship, uh, you will notice that, uh, there is no wake compared to this ship where you can see that there's wake.\n",
      "[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  So things of, uh, uh, you know, uh, small details.\n",
      "[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  And also like, um, essentially that, uh, uh, some, an, an image will obviously not violate the laws of physics.\n",
      "[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  You can probably understand, uh, that, uh, image is fake.\n",
      "[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And then there are other things which you can look at.\n",
      "[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  For example, um, the temperature, the weather data, uh, if the time, if the image showcases a particular timestamp,\n",
      "[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  you can probably even see like, uh, the sunlight direction where it is coming from.\n",
      "[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  And so the shadows will, uh, actually show that, you know,\n",
      "[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  uh, this is a demonstration of how, uh, copy of an object can be copy-pasted as well.\n",
      "[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  And, uh, we, here, you can see that this hovercraft, uh, we can copy and again paste it here.\n",
      "[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  And that, uh, essentially showcases a lot of military strength, uh, kind of to mislead, uh, other countries.\n",
      "[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  But, uh, this is, uh, something which can't be done right now, because this, uh, is kind of, if you see, for example, the first video of which I showed you,\n",
      "[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  of, uh, of Tom Cruise, uh, it's really difficult to detect the fake.\n",
      "[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  So, uh, but there's a problem.\n",
      "[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  And so we have a solution as well.\n",
      "[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  And the first is that we can use an image based model.\n",
      "[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  And so you have this, uh, input video, you're going to extract that into frames.\n",
      "[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  And then you're going to, uh, get, uh, like extract the face from that, uh, frame.\n",
      "[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  So, uh, if you look at the entire image, it might not convey a lot of information and, uh, it's may not be that useful.\n",
      "[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  So if it's a defect video, uh, the typically the part which is manipulated is the face itself.\n",
      "[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  So it's better to just look at the face and then you can, uh, use face alignment techniques to essentially rotate that face, uh, somewhat so that, uh, it's always straight.\n",
      "[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Uh, it just helps, uh, the classifier.\n",
      "[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  And then you're going to pass that to a 2d CNN, uh, CNN is, uh, uh, neural network architecture specifically suited for image tasks.\n",
      "[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  So you can use an architecture like ResNet or an efficient net, and then you can finally make a prediction.\n",
      "[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  And this, uh, so you will get a prediction for every frame in that video.\n",
      "[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  And then you can use some kind of scoring strategy to get your final prediction of the entire video.\n",
      "[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Then you can also use a video based model.\n",
      "[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  So, uh, in the previous approach, uh, we used, uh, uh, an image based so that we were using 2d CNNs.\n",
      "[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  You can also use a 3d CNN.\n",
      "[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And what does that, what that does is essentially looks at both aspects, which is special and temporal.\n",
      "[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  So it kind of, uh, processes the entire video at one go.\n",
      "[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  And you can, uh, since, uh, it's also looking at the temporal aspects.\n",
      "[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  So if there are, uh, artifact, uh, you know, disappearing and appearing in the next frame or something like that, uh, small changes can also be caught by the classifier.\n",
      "[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  Now a defect detection challenge was hosted on, uh, Kaggle.\n",
      "[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Uh, so it was, uh, hosted by, uh, Facebook, Amazon, and, uh, Microsoft.\n",
      "[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Uh, and, uh, and one trend was that they, they call the top performing solutions.\n",
      "[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  Uh, they, uh, didn't use a digital forensic methods like sensor noise, uh, fingerprints, which, uh, can extract a lot of, uh, information from, uh, image creation.\n",
      "[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Uh, like, uh, you know, when you create an image, it, uh, kind of has a lot of information, but if you, let's say, copy paste an, uh, an object, which like we saw, uh, it will add its own, uh, fingerprint noise.\n",
      "[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And that can be easily picked up.\n",
      "[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  So for example, uh, uh, we have a real face at the top and a fake face at the bottom.\n",
      "[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  And if you do, uh, noise level analysis, uh, since this, uh, fake photo has been like, kind of like, it's essentially a face swap.\n",
      "[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Uh, the part of the face, which was swapped and blended, you can see, uh, the, the noise level analysis will kind of reveal that.\n",
      "[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  And, uh, and, uh, and it's the same with error level analysis as well.\n",
      "[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Uh, so this can be kind of, uh, used to detect, uh, defects as well.\n",
      "[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  So there's this paper called face x-ray for more, uh, general fees for detection.\n",
      "[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  And, uh, the good thing is that you don't need, uh, any kind of, uh, defect data set to begin with.\n",
      "[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  So all it needs is a real face, uh, real face, uh, faces, and, uh, it kind of generates, uh, fake faces on its own by essentially, uh, blending those faces.\n",
      "[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Uh, we talked about, uh, landmarks before.\n",
      "[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And the way it, uh, creates its own, uh, sort of fake faces is by it picks up a random image.\n",
      "[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  It will, uh, uh, calculate its landmarks and that will, uh, look for, uh, in, in the data set will look for its closest, uh, pair of image, which also says, uh, similar landmarks.\n",
      "[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  And it just, um, kind of blends those images.\n",
      "[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  And, uh, so what happens is that you, you created this, uh, fake image and you also created, uh, the blending.\n",
      "[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Mask.\n",
      "[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  So the blending mask is where these two sort of, uh, faces got blended.\n",
      "[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  So that you have the background face and the foreground face and wherever the part of the image, the, both the images were kind of blended, you get that final mask.\n",
      "[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  And so, so you have a pair of mask for every fake image that you create.\n",
      "[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  And, um, uh, and essentially if you have a real image, you do not have a face mask.\n",
      "[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Uh, if it's a fake image, you have a face mask.\n",
      "[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  So, uh, uh, essentially what you can do is, uh, image segmentation.\n",
      "[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  So an image segmentation is essentially, uh, splitting an entire frame and to, and drawing like, um, uh, sort of a, uh, an overlay over each and every object, which is different from each other.\n",
      "[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  So for example, over here, you can see a human with a type of overlay and a different overlay on vehicles, for example.\n",
      "[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  So since now we have, uh, uh, created our own dataset.\n",
      "[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  So keep in mind that our own dataset, uh, a fake, a fake image will have this sort of a blending mask and a real face won't show any blending mask.\n",
      "[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  So, uh, essentially you're going to try to predict where that image, uh, has been blended.\n",
      "[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And you can do this using, uh, uh, kind of a unit like architecture, uh, where you have, uh, down sampling and an up sampling network.\n",
      "[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  So, uh, the final prediction is a fake image.\n",
      "[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  If the architecture detects that there is a blending mask, and if it's not a blending mask, if there is no blending mask, it essentially means that the image is real.\n",
      "[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Then you can also, for example, look at, uh, uh, video metadata to essentially, uh, detect if a video is fake.\n",
      "[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And for, for this approach, you do not need, uh, to look at the pixel level.\n",
      "[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  What you instead going to look at is stream descriptors.\n",
      "[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  So every video sort of has, uh, some metadata associated with it.\n",
      "[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  And even if some of the metadata tags are missing, you can use something like FF pro to extract all, uh, like metadata possible from the video.\n",
      "[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  So, and once you gather all these metadata and it contains things like what codec it is using time base, um, uh, FPS, whatever codec it is using audio codec and so on and so forth.\n",
      "[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  And, uh, whenever, uh, a video is kind of manipulated.\n",
      "[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  Some of these, uh, stream descriptors change and it changes in a way, which is not kind of correlated or constant with, uh, real videos.\n",
      "[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  So by essentially looking at, uh, uh, the stream descriptors, you can detect if a video has been manipulated or not.\n",
      "[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  And another strategy is to look at, uh, semantic integrity.\n",
      "[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And that one, what that means is you're going to look at, uh, particular features in an image.\n",
      "[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  So, uh, uh, if you're given an image, uh, you can calculate a lot of stuff from, by looking at its metadata, uh, uh, things like GPS and time.\n",
      "[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  So, you know, uh, the weather data, uh, corresponding to a particular time in a particular GPS location.\n",
      "[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  And you can gather all the weather data from it, like sun angles, temperature, humidity, and weather information.\n",
      "[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  And, uh, you can also train a neural network, uh, to detect, uh, all these things on its own.\n",
      "[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  So just by looking at an image, uh, you can, you want to train a neural network to estimate, uh, all these, uh, values.\n",
      "[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  So, and then you can compare, uh, can you sort of compare, uh, the sun angle calculated by the neural network and the sun, uh, angle, which, uh, uh, which the weather data shows.\n",
      "[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  And, uh, if there is a difference between these two, you can say that, uh, this is a fake.\n",
      "[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  If it is kind of the same, it essentially tells that, uh, it's a real image.\n",
      "[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  So, and the last thing which you can do is.\n",
      "[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Sort of an audio analysis.\n",
      "[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  So, uh, uh, there is something called a spectrogram.\n",
      "[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  A spectrogram can be generated from, uh, raw audio by taking it.\n",
      "[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  So, uh, a fourier transform or wavelength transform or things of that nature.\n",
      "[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:40.060]  So you have this raw audio signal and, uh, you can calculate its, uh, spectrogram and then, uh, kind of train a neural network to detect, uh, fourier transmission.\n",
      "[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Like fake and real videos just by looking at the spectrogram.\n",
      "[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  So the spectrogram is, uh, kind of has very, uh, sort of, you know, peculiar features when, uh, audio is, uh, generated by AI.\n",
      "[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  And by looking at these kinds of features, you can predict, uh, whether, uh, the audio is fake or not.\n",
      "[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Uh, so our deep fake detection pipeline at Sentinel particular has been, you know, kind of modeled after cybersecurity standard of defense in depth.\n",
      "[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  And so we have multiple, uh, kind of neural networks looking at various features, uh, starting from, uh, metadata to semantics, uh, integrity and like, uh, just, uh, image and video based methods.\n",
      "[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  And also look at the audio.\n",
      "[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Now deep fakes aren't all bad, uh, they have their own, uh, good use cases as well, which was kind of what they were invented in the first place.\n",
      "[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  For example, you can bring old memories to life over here.\n",
      "[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  You can, uh, use an app called deep nostalgia, which has been vogue of late.\n",
      "[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  So it kind of, uh, animates, uh, a picture.\n",
      "[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  You can take like any old photograph you have, and it will sort of, uh, you know, animate, animated, which is kind of really nice.\n",
      "[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Also like, for example, if you want to hide your digital identity, uh, you can do that.\n",
      "[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  So there was this documentary shot of, uh, anonymous, uh, survivors of, of the LGBTQ plus, uh, uh, community.\n",
      "[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  And, uh, the, this community was in Chechnya and they did not want to reveal their, uh, identities.\n",
      "[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  So, uh, some volunteers, uh, uh, appeared and they kind of, some people volunteered to, uh, allow their face to be swapped, uh, on these, uh, faces of the survivors.\n",
      "[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  To anonymize them.\n",
      "[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  You also have a lot of, uh, interesting use cases in Hollywood, for example.\n",
      "[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  So, uh, there was, uh, you can see the screenshot, uh, of the film, uh, The Irishman.\n",
      "[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  And over here, uh, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino's, uh, you know, faces were kind of de-aged.\n",
      "[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  And typically this requires, uh, a lot of, uh, first of all, a lot of money.\n",
      "[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  Uh, a lot of money and, uh, a very big, uh, VA VFX studio.\n",
      "[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  And this is kind of, uh, a bottleneck.\n",
      "[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  If, uh, an indie producer or a small scale production house wants to do these kind of, uh, um, you know, apply these kind of VFX technologies.\n",
      "[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  But, uh, with, uh, defix, this barrier is kind of lowered a lot.\n",
      "[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  So there goes, uh, to democratizing Hollywood.\n",
      "[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  And of course you can, uh, improve your virtual interactions by, uh, animating your digital avatar.\n",
      "[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  So I generated this avatar from a website called Ready Player Me.\n",
      "[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  And then you can kind of, uh, animate the space, uh, into the way you want to talk.\n",
      "[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  So it, it kind of improves your virtual interactions, uh, in the age of, uh, digitization.\n",
      "[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  And with that, uh, I would like to wrap up my talk and thank you for coming to my PI Data Talk.\n",
      "[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  Uh, I'll be taking questions.\n",
      "[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Uh, we have one question, uh, from Dimitrios.\n",
      "[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  Uh, does the FSGAN generate ships too?\n",
      "[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  No, it's just for the face, right?\n",
      "[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  It's, uh, only for faces, so like defix.\n",
      "[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Uh, we have a question from Veli, but I think it's missing some context.\n",
      "[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  How about audio using what data can you elaborate on that?\n",
      "[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Uh, so the, if you have like audio clippings of a real and like fake, uh, audio, like you\n",
      "[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  can like train a neural network on it.\n",
      "[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Uh, like the first step you need to do is to essentially, uh, get a spectrogram of that\n",
      "[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  audio clip and then, uh, just look at the spectrogram.\n",
      "[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  So that'd be done by a neural network.\n",
      "[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Great.\n",
      "[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  Any other questions?\n",
      "[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Oh, yes.\n",
      "[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Uh, okay.\n",
      "[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  A question from Steven, uh, will the detection method you've talked about distinguish between\n",
      "[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  deepfake and more com, more cosmetic or artistic changes?\n",
      "[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  Uh, sorry, I'm not sure to understand the question.\n",
      "[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Uh, so some of the, if the data is kind of, you know, labeled as a deepfake, it will only\n",
      "[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  like detect if there's a deepfake.\n",
      "[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  So you have like cosmetic changes, it won't be picked up.\n",
      "[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  But if you train a classifier to particularly look at, uh, you know, cosmetic changes, then\n",
      "[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  it will be picked up.\n",
      "[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  We have a question from Andy.\n",
      "[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Is there a large scale demand for detecting deepfakes or other than, other than cases such\n",
      "[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  as Google, Facebook, other social media?\n",
      "[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  Uh, yeah.\n",
      "[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  So apart from, uh, you know, big companies, uh, there is also like, uh, governments, uh,\n",
      "[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  and security agencies which need it.\n",
      "[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  So for example, DARPA, which is the R and D wing of the United States of America.\n",
      "[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  They have, uh, been, uh, had, they have a lot of funding and they are trying to detect,\n",
      "[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  uh, deepfakes and essentially any kind of, uh, video manipulation.\n",
      "[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.100]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Uh, that's another question from Bushida.\n",
      "[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Uh, how do you know which portion, uh, of a picture frame to check for deepfake?\n",
      "[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  Um, so the procedure is like, uh, you pass in the entire video.\n",
      "[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  So, and then you can like split that video into frames and every frame is going to be checked.\n",
      "[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  And now if your question is to deal like which portions of a particular frame that you want\n",
      "[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  to look at.\n",
      "[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  Uh, so, so typically in a deepfake video, uh, uh, video, the part which is manipulated is the face.\n",
      "[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  So you can just crop out the face and then you can, uh, like, uh, like look at like particular features.\n",
      "[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  So, uh, and the way you can extract faces from a frame is by, sorry, by using some sort of a face detector.\n",
      "[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  So something like empty CNN, uh, would work.\n",
      "[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Great.\n",
      "[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  Um, I can see that there's a question.\n",
      "[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  If, uh, the effects are getting harder to detect.\n",
      "[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  And, uh, yes, it is.\n",
      "[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Uh, it's always kind of like a cat and mouse game where the detectors, uh, beat the generators\n",
      "[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  and the generators then again, uh, beat the detectors.\n",
      "[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  So we have to improve, uh, our detection methods.\n",
      "[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  And, uh, as you notice, like we have, like, there are a lot of ways how you can detect.\n",
      "[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  So, uh, and if you kind of utilize multiple methods, uh, it's kind of gets very hard for\n",
      "[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  the generators, uh, to essentially make sure that all of these kinds of, uh, features are\n",
      "[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  taken into account when they're generating.\n",
      "[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  Great.\n",
      "[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  I think we did all the question.\n",
      "[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  Uh, if you have any more, uh, if you have more question, uh, we can all meet in one.\n",
      "[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  Uh, so we talk at the start, uh, this is basically a platform, um, to, uh, be able to interact\n",
      "[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  in smaller group, to have a kind of a more meetup like feeling.\n",
      "[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  So you will be able to create small group and have a chat about whatever you want.\n",
      "[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Uh, so, but I will, so, um, thank you again, Newadri, uh, for your talk.\n",
      "[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  It was really interesting.\n",
      "[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Uh, I will stop recording and the live on YouTube.\n",
      "[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  On YouTube, if you want to join, you can also go to the meetup page, uh, uh, on the\n",

      "[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  you want to join from there.\n",

      "Speaker 0: Pi Data Berlin team. As far as I can see, maybe some others. Daniel, I guess. Daniel? We are Daniel. Yes, we are the building chapter of Pi Data and Pi Data, as some of you may have heard before, is the educational program of NumFocus and we will talk about, it will be introduced very soon. Our program for today is me, I am your introduction, happening now. And then we will have the second talk from Miladri Shekhardut about deepfake and why he has trust issues. Let's hope we can solve them to some. Yeah, some of them today. In between, we will have a five minute break. And at the end, we can all meet up in this nice platform called Wonder. And later we will post in the chat the link so we can all gather there later. This meetup is recorded, so both talks are recorded and are also streamed now in YouTube, so please take it into consideration. Also, if you are watching on YouTube, you can also write down the questions in the YouTube chat and we will pass them on to the speaker. So yeah, as I mentioned, we are PI Data Berlin. We are the local chapter of PI Data, which is kind of a worldwide thing. We started in 2016 and we had quite a lot of fun meetups and conferences ever since. We have a code of conduct, which is the non-focus code of conduct. In short, be kind to each other and please remember that the code of conduct applies also when we are online. There is also a PI Data Science channel that you can follow and also handle if there are job posts there or you can ask technical problems.\n",
      "Speaker 1: I will stop the share now. It is sharing screen and I think Valentina will introduce our first speaker. Yeah, hi everyone. I'm Valentina, also co-organizer of PI Data. I have the pleasure to introduce my colleague, Katia, who will be speaking about how Planet operates more than 100 satellites using Agile Aerospace. We have questions both in YouTube and I guess here. Yeah. So the design life is up to three years.\n",
      "Speaker 2: Thanks, Valentina. Thanks to PI Data for having me. So we are actually a small team of people, less than 10. And just, I want to start with showing you what does the constellation that we operate look like. I think visual way is the best way to do it. Thanks. Thanks. Right. So this is a day in the life of the doves. So we call our satellites doves because they remind us to that they have two wings. So, yeah, we just, we call them doves. And then a group of satellites, we will call them flogs. So basically what our sites are doing, they are taking, they are air sensing, air remote sensing satellites. So they are taking pictures of our Earth continuously, exactly as the simulation shows. And having that constellation on the space allows us to take daily images of the entire landmass of the Earth. And by having all that data, then we are able to inform decision makers and provide the visibility on changes that happen on the day to day that weren't available before. So we had actually three types of satellites. So when I started working on space operations, I was working with the Rapid Eye constellation. So last year. So we have this huge archive of data. And of course, even though they were designed to last six to seven years, they outgrow that that period of time. So they continue taking images even years after. But it reaches a point where, you know, there's such degradation that we we wanted to make sure that we had the capability of lowering their orbit so that they could be safely. safely re-enter the atmosphere within a time that is responsible. And then. Then we have the doves and super doves. So we have two generations of satellites and that's why we call them super doves. And we currently have in orbit more than 180 of these sets. So to give you a sense of the scale, how different these sets are to the Rapid Eye. So the Rapid Eye are like a mini fridge and the doves are like a shoebox size. Like, yeah, they're very small, but they have very similar capabilities. So they take images what we call medium resolution. So that means a pixel is equivalent to three meters. Um, and then they, they image the earth on different bands. So there are the visual bands that we see red, green, blue, and then additional bands that will help us identify things like vegetation. These are, uh, we currently have 21 in a space and these are about the same size as the Rapid Eye. So also like a mini fridge. Uh, but these sets have the capability of taking like really high resolution images. So, um, submit, sub meter resolution. Um, Okay. So that's what we have on a space. Um, so this is in a nutshell, what our system looks like. Um, so there's the space segment. So, which is all this group of satellites. So operations is not only about taking care of the satellites that are on space, but also taking care of the, um, of the systems on ground that support the space system. Um, so I'm going to go into the detail on the radio frequencies and all, but there are like, uh, to simplify, there are two types of communication. So a low speed one and a high speed one. So with low speed communication, we can get health data from the satellites and, um, upload commands to them. Um, how each of these resources are used, like, um, to which satellites each antenna talking, uh, how many times a day, uh, what is each satellite doing on a given day? Like, where is it taking images? Um, when it's supposed to, uh, point to the ground station to download data, when it's supposed to point to, to the ground and actually take a picture. Um, so those systems are also, uh, built in house, um, so for us, so there is a scheduler that will make sure to de-conflict those resources. Um, there is mission control. You see like a lot of monitors, each of them monitoring a subsystem and then engineers behind them. Um, you know, sending the commands and make monitoring the, the telemetry that comes from the spacecraft. So basically that's what mission control does. Um, but in a different setup. And then I can come on the satellites from there. like a place where we store all the data that comes down. So we have logs, we have telemetry, we have pictures. Uh, and we want to make sure that all these systems are built such that we can build on top of them. So that they all have endpoints that we can query that data, uh, with other scripts that will run on top. Um, so those were designed from the very beginning with that on mind. Um, yeah, and then we have a different, what we call pipeline for, for the images. Uh, that's a different storage where, um, each of the pictures get processed and there's some quality checks in between. So we have to process all that data, of course, uh, in a very automated way. Um, yeah. And then once the images go through all that processing pipeline and image quality checks, then they get published and delivered on a platform that are, that our customers can, can access. Um, cool. Um, of course, this wasn't like the picture at the beginning. Um, so we, we use agile aerospace on everything, but what does agile aerospace mean? So it's on its core is rapid iteration. Um, so on everything. It was actually not just one model. Uh, so we have had more than 13 iterations over time. Now we are past 13. And if that works, then that will become the next. Um, the next version to launch. So that's how we have been able to progress very quickly and get like always the latest and best packed into these three unique cubesat form over the years. Um, and that also, that also happens on, um, on the software side. Um, with, with having a scale, like scalability on mind, knowing that, okay, now we are operating 20 sets, but in a year we might have 200 on orbit. Um, so that makes things easier and makes the system, um, just robust, um, to handle what, um, what comes on the roadmap. Um, and I want to make a pause, um, talking about agile to, um, go in, get into something exciting, which is, this is also agile. Um, so to have that large number of satellites on the space, you need to launch them. There are only enough launchers in the world. Um, so we had, uh, launches. Okay. Thanks. So we launched from a European rocket, the Vega there. We had 26 of our newest DOFs, which we call super DOFs. Um, and then something interesting of that rocket is we had two different deployers. So, uh, that was something new for us. Um, and then we launched six of our high resolution sky sets, um, with SpaceX. ground station network, um, last year collected over five petabytes of data. Um, yeah. And our most recent launch was actually on January. Um, I put this, cause this was very exciting. for any, um, any rocket launch, but this was a SpaceX, uh, record breaking one. Cause this was the most, uh, small sets ever launched altogether. So 143 satellites were put all together on this rocket and they all, um, had the same ride. Um, this is one of the images that, um, one of our sites that were launched on that, on Cool. Um, now I'm going to talk about how they operate. So the concept of operations, so that you have an idea of what we have to do as a space operations then for automation. Um, so our doves, um, are a monitoring mission. So monitoring means they are always taking pictures, uh, over landmass. Um, cause that, that's our point of interest. Um, and then like, if they are not taking images, then they are talking to the ground stations as a line scanner separated, like in the video, we need to phase them out. So space them out along the orbital plane. And to do that, we use, um, differential drag maneuvers. So like the satellite will be rotating so that, um, the atmospheric drag will affect its position in relation to the others. And they will slowly separate, uh, among the plane. So those three things. Uh, so it's pretty simple. Um, well, it sounds simple. Um, but yeah, that's basically what the sets, uh, have to do. Um, and one important thing to mention is like, um, we don't do 24 seven ops. So there's not a person that are looking what each satellite is doing all the time. Um, so what we call nominal operations is, uh, basically all the tasks to make sure that the So for us that, you know, it's, it's able to take pictures and it's taking pictures and Um, so the first thing of all is like, how do you tell the satellite what to do? Um, so there comes the scheduler. So the scheduler is, um, an optimizer building house that will every day, um, you know, uh, score, um, uh, areas of the, of the lack of the landmass that each of the satellite can best, um, can distribute, um, images, imaging activities, we call them. So it has a lot of other parameters and then it optimized for how to better distribute all the available time, um, that the ground stations have. um, schedules for the satellites. Um, yeah, so that's very important. Also important, not only for the space segment, but also for the ground, um, network. So we have, um, more than 40 antennas distributed across the world. So it will be just unsustainable to have, you know, persons dedicated on each of the, in each of the locations. And also the, they have to act as a network. Um, and instead of like, you know, looking at each of those, um, each of that data. So, uh, yeah, it, it needs to be automated. Um, and also the way the images are processed. So, um, yeah. So let me talk about what are our tasks. So from the moment, um, um, you know, we have a space operation. Um, the satellites are manufactured on ground and then they're put on a rocket and then they are launched. So as, as soon as they leave the deployer of the rocket and they are in space, um, that's where our task starts. Um, be tumbling the satellite. So that's what they are deployed. They are tumbling at a given rate. So all of that process needs to be done for each of these satellites. Um, and as soon as we can. And actually this last launch was one of our best commissioning process. So we, something that would take in the past, um, more than a week to do. So commissioning will last like per satellite. About seven to 10 days. Um, so once the satellites are commissioned and they are starting to do, you know, what they have to do, taking pictures and downloading, uh, we move into a monitoring stage. So we have to monitor that. And not unexpected things are happening. That anomalies, um, are being resolved or are being caught. Um, and then at the same time, as part of our, um, Agile Aerospace, we will, um, continuously test things on orbit. So we call them experiments or test things. Um, so obviously we have, um, testing on ground. So we have, uh, we call them canaries. So they're like the, um, or staging sats. Um, and then anomaly debugging, of course. So when something comes up and we need to fix it, uh, we need to look into it. Um, but we are also working towards making these more autonomously. Um, then yeah, uh, software, uh, we continuously update the software that is running on board the satellite. Um, so that's a big part of testing on ground and also testing on orbit. And then when the satellites reach their end of life, then there's a retirement process. Um, what to expect from next, uh, from next generation satellites. All right. So, um, moving into how a space operations change, uh, with the amount of satellites. So, but the, the principal, the principal, uh, feature was that we wanted to have a mission control that will be able to talk to the ground stations and handle, um, the communication with the satellites on its own. So that was a, uh, key stepping stone. You know, like what data we should be looking at. So basically gather operational experience. So logs that, um, capture things that were happening on ground or things that were happening, um, on board the satellite. Um, and then we'll have some sort of, um, scripting that will filter or group things, um, like similar warnings or similar captures. And then we'll, we'll have that summary per satellite. Uh, you need to evaluate every alert. And as we were constantly iterating, there were new, um, new things or new features on the satellite. So there were different performance value across satellites. And of course, as the number increased, there was more data to parse through. So, um, I remember there were days where like it took us half a day, half a working day to go through all of the alerts. Um, so what changed? So we had to move from the, uh, traditional space operations mentality of let's look at what happens with each individual set to what do we expect from the whole fleet? Um, so we shift that, uh, on our minds and say, okay, let's first look at the value of the constellation. So what we look at now, it's, um, we build, uh, metrics with scripts, uh, that will aggregate that data for us. And that will be the first indicator. If the fleet as a whole, um, it's operating as it should. And then the second layer is identifying, um, the doves or the sets, um, on the fleet that have some non-nominal behavior. Uh, but we don't want to do that by looking at each of them. Uh, but there has been this deviation. And then we just want to see the alert. And we want to see the alert on the specific thing that we have to look at. How do we mitigate this? Uh, so once we have the mitigation, but we want the next time this happens that we have a script on top. We have a script that detects the issue. And then we have a script that just applies the resolution automatically. So without us knowing, but of course we, we want to have visibility on how many times this happens. And so rather than a person looking through something and then some, there's some delay time between like, okay, coming up with the response and applying the response. Um, so, I mean, this is a very simple diagram of what we have in place, um, as a space operations, uh, but it's basically that. So we have the different, uh, entities of the system. Uh, we have orbit data from the sides. We have telemetry, we have logs. Um, all of these data is stored in such way that we can, um, that we have endpoints to query that data from. So it's easy for us, um, to build the scripts on top. We have a lot of, um, scripts that like a, uh, group of them that we call mission metrics that will tell us everything from the high level. So it just gives us the granularity that we need. And also it abstracts to, um, true high level metrics. Um, and then we, we can decide how to use this data. That's the right thing. Do analysis on, do analysis on, on Python notebooks or simply like display the data on visual ways. Like using tools like Grafana or Kibana. Um, so it just, it's just like a very powerful, uh, way of, um, using data analysis on any issue that can come up. Um, yeah. Yeah. Um, this is one specific example of one of the automations. Uh, this might be going into too much detail. And actually one of my colleagues talked about it. Um, about this specific use case. Well, PI data about more than a year ago now. So the duty cycle is how many times in a day the satellite will spend imaging, uh, the earth. The power depends on, um, the sun, the sun beta angle. Um, so we want to make sure that our power models and the duty cycle includes that change. So we want to make sure that we know that and the satellite knows that. So that is not overdoing itself. Like it's not trying to take more pictures with the power that it doesn't have. I'm like checking every time of the year when we have to change these. If there is a deep and a flag has triggered on the power system, then it will say, Oh, you are doing, you're doing much more than what you need to do. So it's doing that tuning for us. And by doing that, we are keeping the satellite healthy. Um, yeah. Yeah. So what's next? Uh, and now we are trying to explore with machine learning applications. Um, and actually these are some applications that, you know, where, where Python or, or, um, any type of data analysis is super powerful. Uh, it's to play, not to play, but to actually use the data that comes down from the satellites. Um, so to me, this is a very, oops, sorry. Um, yeah, you can see the deforestation, how it's increasing across the days. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Katia. That's very interesting. I mean, I'm biased. to true stories.\n",
      "Speaker 3: So we know, okay, um, we have a better model for forecasting. So, cause we have daily images. I see a question. Are there images available to the public? Um, there are two different programs. Um, so just, uh, recently we signed, uh, um, an agreement with the Norway government. It's called NIFKI. Um, you know, that's where my trust issues, you know, kind of, you know, begin. Uh, in 2021, uh, this is what you can do. And this is not that uncommon. So, uh, you can see a lot of these defects, uh, being used to essentially, um, alter public And now if your question is to deal like which portions of a particular frame that you want to look at. Yeah. Great. Uh, if you have any more, uh, if you have more question, uh, we can all meet in one. you want to join from there. Uh, stop me. Okay.\n",
      "Speaker 4: So in an autoencoder architecture, there is typically three blocks. So one is the encoder. Uh, one is the bottleneck and you have the decoder.\n",
      "Speaker 5: use, uh, the fake technology was kind of like only like, uh, experts could use it, let's down. So right now the true estimation is, uh, around a hundred million plus defects in 2021. And a lot of them have to do with the easy to use apps. So there's this very popular app called, uh, uh, reface. Uh, it actually was trending at one point. Like it was trending at a number one in entertainment. It also beat, uh, TikTok. So, uh, it allows you to, uh, to easily create the fake videos. And, uh, this was a news article, which I read yesterday. It was a mother, uh, uh, using the fake to actually frame her daughter's, uh, rivals that, uh, they were doing, uh, like essentially create a fake video of their rivals. celebrities are used to, for political agendas. It could, the next victim could be you or me. So this is, has like, probably like that now is like the tipping point. So the cost of disinformation annually as estimated in 2019, it was around 78 billion. and the target are, and essentially swaps these and creates a superimposition to manipulate, uh, a face swap defake. And then you have the second type, which is facial reenactment. So, uh, what happens is that, uh, you have the source video and, uh, and the target. So, uh, you can like, for example, make, uh, facial movements or speak anything you want. And that will kind of be mimicked on, uh, the target face. So you could make any person say anything that you want. And this is kind of a pretty dangerous, right? So there was this case where, uh, company CEO was, uh, uh, so a defect of the company CEO was used to mimic a wire transfer of around $243,000. And, uh, this has been a rising problem. So let's look at this video. Uh, let's see how you can probably figure this out. When Mexico sends its people. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems. And they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. So, uh, maybe, you know, if you've seen this, uh, if it's a fake or not a real. So, and that's, you, you know, where the trust issue really starts to begin, where you even start to doubt what's a real video. And you think probably that's a fake. So it's kind of, uh, when Mexico sends its people, they're not sending. And, uh, the trust issues start to increase and, uh, probably like to the moon. So there was, uh, this, uh, um, report published by, uh, Republican hub, uh, Republican candidate. Now that that's of course, uh, false. But, uh, it's that just because, uh, you there, just because the fake exists, it kind of puts into jeopardy. You probably just create created it. So, uh, some of the trust issues are like, uh, you know, the fake can be used to, uh, cause fraud, uh, espionage inside mental or physical harm. Like we saw in case, uh, of the, uh, journalist. Uh, where someone's, uh, says are rather black males that a person's, uh, defake, uh, porn might be used. So what does, what does the future hold? Uh, so now, right now we have, uh, AI generated, uh, text. And now you have, uh, defigs to generate any kind of video or GANs to generate any kind of image. So you essentially have all the tools to generate whatever event you want, and you can do that at scale. So how does defig work? And the decoder decodes that information again to, uh, that previous image. So usually the decoder just reconstructs the, tries to reconstruct that input. Now with the autoencoders, you can do multiple things. So, uh, we'll actually need two, uh, autoencoders for, uh, creating defects. So, uh, so the first part is, uh, the top part, which you see is the source image and the bottom is the target. So the source images, uh, we could be yourself and the target is that whatever you want to impose, uh, like, uh, target person. Let's say you want to swap, uh, Donald Trump's image on, uh, Alec Baldwin. So Alec Baldwin here is the target and Donald Trump here is the source. And, uh, we have two separate decoders. So, uh, for the source, um, input to, we are going to encode it. And again, decode it exactly, uh, to Donald Trump's, uh, image. And for the, um, uh, target, we are going to do the same. And this is what happens in the training pad. And when you want to actually generate, uh, the, the, let's say a defig, what you're going to do is let's say use the encoder part for, uh, for Donald Trump's image and use the decoder part for Alec Baldwin's. Now, uh, this is not exactly like state-of-the-art stuff because, uh, there's a lot of artifacts usually present. And, uh, with the previous approach, uh, you will need like pairs of, uh, videos. So it would, uh, require a lot of training and you can't exactly use that, uh, for like inference or like testing whenever you want. And what that means is that you do not, uh, need, uh, you know, a pairwise training. So, uh, so if you do not have a source, uh, on a target video, uh, um, like a training data of it. So, uh, you can still use this because, uh, when you actually want to use this, um, uh, sort of architecture to create your own defect, you do not need to gather a lot of data and need a pairs of source image and target video. So how does this work is by using something called as the generative adversarial network. Uh, then the way it works is that you have two blocks. Essentially one is the generator and another is the discriminator. The generators, uh, essentially creates, uh, uh, no fake images. And the discriminator's job is to, um, try to differentiate between the real images and fake images. And the discriminator does this really well at first, but ultimately the generator actually manages to fool the discriminator into thinking that the fake image is a real image. And by generating these kind of, uh, uh, you know, uh, this sort of a training procedure, we're actually able to create, uh, fake images, which are very, uh, lifelike. Uh, such kind of sort of the stuff that you saw in the beginning, uh, very, very Freudian image of a fake person. So how does this work in FS scan is that, uh, for example, if you have the source and you have the target, uh, what you calculate first is kind of like landmarks. So these, so these would be guiding face landmarks. So a landmark is essentially, uh, what you see on the left over here. And, uh, so it contains, uh, you know, points to, uh, your face, uh, and it picks out like, uh, very specific, uh, and important features of your face, which can be used to represent. So, uh, in this first part, you have these guys sort of guiding face landmarks. And, uh, this will be used, uh, to kind of, uh, first, uh, be passed to a generator to, first of all, align this, uh, source face into sort of the way the target's face is, uh, uh, looking at. So the, so the first thing which happens over here is the post correction. And, uh, over here, uh, the target space will be, uh, passed, uh, another generator, which kind of separates, uh, all these. Um, uh, like separates the various, uh, parts of the face. So you have the face separated out and the other parts of the image will be, again, separate out like the hair or a urine or something like that. And then essentially, uh, uh, we'd be kind of, uh, using the landmarks, which we got to essentially train, uh, our generator. To, uh, essentially make, uh, generate images, uh, uh, essentially gets, uh, sort of like how the movement of the faces, uh, working. So we have multiple images. So if it's a video, we can extract them multiple frames and we get, uh, a lot of these, uh, landmarks. So that's why you have multiple landmarks. So, uh, uh, kind of the sources of face in a way the target's face is moving. And once you have that, you can, uh, uh, do something called as in painting. So typically, uh, once we have this image, uh, you can see like a lot of parts on this image are kind of, uh, not completed. And this is very typical because you will always have partial occlusions. And that can be filled up by an in painting, uh, network, which essentially fills up this, uh, image, uh, by picking up detail from the target face. So whatever, uh, you know, missing features are from the source, you can probably pick it up on the target's face and create something and complete this image. So, you know, really blended well to the target's face to the point of looking like, uh, you know, very lifelike. And, uh, this is, uh, open source, so you can try this out. Uh, it's present in the GitHub repository of the paper, which is called FSGAN. And they also have a Colab notebook, so you can try it out really fast. So let's, uh, look at how you can actually spot a fake image. And this will be a manual procedure. And this was released by North Korea's, uh, central news agency. And they were trying to, uh, show a military exercise where North Korea's, uh, hovercrafts, uh, sorry, hovercrafts, uh, were, uh, were landing on the east coast. So, and over here you can see it like, uh, they have multiple, uh, hovercrafts here. And it's actually a fake image. So over here, if you see, uh, this, uh, left, um, block. And if you compare it with the right block, you'll see that it looks exactly similar. So this was, uh, essentially a copy paste of the, um, of this object over here. So things of, uh, uh, you know, uh, small details. And also like, um, essentially that, uh, uh, some, an, an image will obviously not violate the laws of physics. You can probably understand, uh, that, uh, image is fake. And then there are other things which you can look at. For example, um, the temperature, the weather data, uh, if the time, if the image showcases a particular timestamp, you can probably even see like, uh, the sunlight direction where it is coming from. And so the shadows will, uh, actually show that, you know, uh, this is a demonstration of how, uh, copy of an object can be copy-pasted as well. And, uh, we, here, you can see that this hovercraft, uh, we can copy and again paste it here. And that, uh, essentially showcases a lot of military strength, uh, kind of to mislead, uh, other countries. of, uh, of Tom Cruise, uh, it's really difficult to detect the fake. So, uh, but there's a problem. And so we have a solution as well. And the first is that we can use an image based model. And then you're going to, uh, get, uh, like extract the face from that, uh, frame. So if it's a defect video, uh, the typically the part which is manipulated is the face itself. So it's better to just look at the face and then you can, uh, use face alignment techniques to essentially rotate that face, uh, somewhat so that, uh, it's always straight. Uh, it just helps, uh, the classifier. And then you're going to pass that to a 2d CNN, uh, CNN is, uh, uh, neural network architecture specifically suited for image tasks. So you can use an architecture like ResNet or an efficient net, and then you can finally make a prediction. And this, uh, so you will get a prediction for every frame in that video. And then you can use some kind of scoring strategy to get your final prediction of the entire video. Then you can also use a video based model. So, uh, in the previous approach, uh, we used, uh, uh, an image based so that we were using 2d CNNs. You can also use a 3d CNN. And what does that, what that does is essentially looks at both aspects, which is special and temporal. So it kind of, uh, processes the entire video at one go. And you can, uh, since, uh, it's also looking at the temporal aspects. So if there are, uh, artifact, uh, you know, disappearing and appearing in the next frame or something like that, uh, small changes can also be caught by the classifier. Now a defect detection challenge was hosted on, uh, Kaggle. Uh, and, uh, and one trend was that they, they call the top performing solutions. And that can be easily picked up. So for example, uh, uh, we have a real face at the top and a fake face at the bottom. And if you do, uh, noise level analysis, uh, since this, uh, fake photo has been like, kind of like, it's essentially a face swap. Uh, the part of the face, which was swapped and blended, you can see, uh, the, the noise level analysis will kind of reveal that. And, uh, and, uh, and it's the same with error level analysis as well. Uh, so this can be kind of, uh, used to detect, uh, defects as well. So there's this paper called face x-ray for more, uh, general fees for detection. And, uh, the good thing is that you don't need, uh, any kind of, uh, defect data set to begin with. So all it needs is a real face, uh, real face, uh, faces, and, uh, it kind of generates, uh, fake faces on its own by essentially, uh, blending those faces. Uh, we talked about, uh, landmarks before. And it just, um, kind of blends those images. And, uh, so what happens is that you, you created this, uh, fake image and you also created, uh, the blending. Mask. So the blending mask is where these two sort of, uh, faces got blended. So that you have the background face and the foreground face and wherever the part of the image, the, both the images were kind of blended, you get that final mask. And so, so you have a pair of mask for every fake image that you create. Uh, if it's a fake image, you have a face mask. So, uh, uh, essentially what you can do is, uh, image segmentation. So an image segmentation is essentially, uh, splitting an entire frame and to, and drawing like, um, uh, sort of a, uh, an overlay over each and every object, which is different from each other. So for example, over here, you can see a human with a type of overlay and a different overlay on vehicles, for example. So since now we have, uh, uh, created our own dataset. So, uh, essentially you're going to try to predict where that image, uh, has been blended. And you can do this using, uh, uh, kind of a unit like architecture, uh, where you have, uh, down sampling and an up sampling network. So, uh, the final prediction is a fake image. And for, for this approach, you do not need, uh, to look at the pixel level. What you instead going to look at is stream descriptors. So every video sort of has, uh, some metadata associated with it. And even if some of the metadata tags are missing, you can use something like FF pro to extract all, uh, like metadata possible from the video. So, and once you gather all these metadata and it contains things like what codec it is using time base, um, uh, FPS, whatever codec it is using audio codec and so on and so forth. And, uh, whenever, uh, a video is kind of manipulated. Some of these, uh, stream descriptors change and it changes in a way, which is not kind of correlated or constant with, uh, real videos. So by essentially looking at, uh, uh, the stream descriptors, you can detect if a video has been manipulated or not. And another strategy is to look at, uh, semantic integrity. And that one, what that means is you're going to look at, uh, particular features in an image. So, uh, uh, if you're given an image, uh, you can calculate a lot of stuff from, by looking at its metadata, uh, uh, things like GPS and time. So, you know, uh, the weather data, uh, corresponding to a particular time in a particular GPS location. And you can gather all the weather data from it, like sun angles, temperature, humidity, and weather information. So just by looking at an image, uh, you can, you want to train a neural network to estimate, uh, all these, uh, values. So, and then you can compare, uh, can you sort of compare, uh, the sun angle calculated by the neural network and the sun, uh, angle, which, uh, uh, which the weather data shows. And, uh, if there is a difference between these two, you can say that, uh, this is a fake. If it is kind of the same, it essentially tells that, uh, it's a real image. So, and the last thing which you can do is. Sort of an audio analysis. A spectrogram can be generated from, uh, raw audio by taking it. So, uh, a fourier transform or wavelength transform or things of that nature. So you have this raw audio signal and, uh, you can calculate its, uh, spectrogram and then, uh, kind of train a neural network to detect, uh, fourier transmission. Like fake and real videos just by looking at the spectrogram. So the spectrogram is, uh, kind of has very, uh, sort of, you know, peculiar features when, uh, audio is, uh, generated by AI. And by looking at these kinds of features, you can predict, uh, whether, uh, the audio is fake or not. Uh, so our deep fake detection pipeline at Sentinel particular has been, you know, kind of modeled after cybersecurity standard of defense in depth. And also look at the audio. For example, you can bring old memories to life over here. You can, uh, use an app called deep nostalgia, which has been vogue of late. So it kind of, uh, animates, uh, a picture. Also like, for example, if you want to hide your digital identity, uh, you can do that. So there was this documentary shot of, uh, anonymous, uh, survivors of, of the LGBTQ plus, uh, uh, community. And, uh, the, this community was in Chechnya and they did not want to reveal their, uh, identities. You also have a lot of, uh, interesting use cases in Hollywood, for example. So, uh, there was, uh, you can see the screenshot, uh, of the film, uh, The Irishman. And over here, uh, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino's, uh, you know, faces were kind of de-aged. And typically this requires, uh, a lot of, uh, first of all, a lot of money. If, uh, an indie producer or a small scale production house wants to do these kind of, uh, um, you know, apply these kind of VFX technologies. But, uh, with, uh, defix, this barrier is kind of lowered a lot. So there goes, uh, to democratizing Hollywood. So I generated this avatar from a website called Ready Player Me. And then you can kind of, uh, animate the space, uh, into the way you want to talk. So it, it kind of improves your virtual interactions, uh, in the age of, uh, digitization. Uh, I'll be taking questions. Okay. Uh, we have one question, uh, from Dimitrios. Uh, does the FSGAN generate ships too? No, it's just for the face, right? Yeah. It's, uh, only for faces, so like defix. How about audio using what data can you elaborate on that? Uh, so the, if you have like audio clippings of a real and like fake, uh, audio, like you can like train a neural network on it. Uh, like the first step you need to do is to essentially, uh, get a spectrogram of that audio clip and then, uh, just look at the spectrogram. So that'd be done by a neural network. Great. Any other questions? deepfake and more com, more cosmetic or artistic changes? Uh, sorry, I'm not sure to understand the question. Uh, so some of the, if the data is kind of, you know, labeled as a deepfake, it will only like detect if there's a deepfake. So you have like cosmetic changes, it won't be picked up. But if you train a classifier to particularly look at, uh, you know, cosmetic changes, then it will be picked up. We have a question from Andy. Is there a large scale demand for detecting deepfakes or other than, other than cases such Uh, yeah. So apart from, uh, you know, big companies, uh, there is also like, uh, governments, uh, and security agencies which need it. So for example, DARPA, which is the R and D wing of the United States of America. They have, uh, been, uh, had, they have a lot of funding and they are trying to detect, Yeah. If, uh, the effects are getting harder to detect. Yeah. And, uh, yes, it is. Uh, it's always kind of like a cat and mouse game where the detectors, uh, beat the generators and the generators then again, uh, beat the detectors. So we have to improve, uh, our detection methods. Uh, so, but I will, so, um, thank you again, Newadri, uh, for your talk. It was really interesting. Uh, I will stop recording and the live on YouTube. I will. ihm. Um, I will. I will. I will. I will.\n"
